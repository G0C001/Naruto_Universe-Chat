SHONENIUME I. 


The other night, during a bad 
rainstorm, | happened to peer 
out the window. “Look at all that 
rain... Wat... P!!" it wasn't just 
the rain’ Rainwater had started 
accumulating on my veranda, 
forming a pool of water! The 
drain had gotten clogged, and it 
created a scene similar to the 
one in Poryo! | was afraid for 
the first time in a while... 





_Masashi Kishinroto, 2070 


Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

THE STORY SO FAR... 


Naruto, the biggest troublemaker at the Ninja Academy in the Village 
of Konohagakure, finally becomes a ninja along with his classmates 
Sasuke and Sakura. They grow and mature through countless trials and 
battles. However, Sasuke, unable to give up his quest for vengeance, 
leaves Konohagakure to seek Orochimaru and his power... 

Two years pass. Naruto grows up and engages in fierce battles against 
the Tailed Beast-targeting Akatsuki. Elsewhere, after winning the heroic 
battle against Itachi and learning his older brother's true intentions, 
Sasuke allies with the Akatsuki and sets out to destroy Konoha. 

Upon Madara’s declaration of war, an Allied Shinobi Force is formed. 
Naruto, sent away in the name of protecting the jinchtriki, succeeds in 
taking in Nine Tails’ chakra. Plus, when his mother reappears to explain 
the secrets of his birth, Naruto accepts his parents’ hopes and renews 
his vow to become Hokage!
