Story & Art by 


Masashi Kishi 





Recently, DVDs have become 
prominent at movie rental 
stores. Certainly, DVDs are nice 
because unlike videotapes, you 
can just rent one disc and not 
have to choose what kind of 
audio track you want or whether 
you want subtitles or not until 
right when you watch it. That's 
really great, but...OVDs don't 
include coming attractions 
before the main feature. That's 
what | was looking forward to... 





—Masashi Kishimoto, 2002 


Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in |997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.
