It’s been a year since | moved 
into my current apartment and | 
just recently realized something... 
| can see Mbt. Fuji from my porch. 
Ib took me this long to notice! 


—_Masashi Kishitmoto, 2004 





Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

Kimimaro 
























Twelve years ago a destructive nine-tailed fox spirit 
attacked the ninja village of Konohagakure. The Hokage, 
or village champion, defeated the fox by sealing its soul 
into the body of a baby boy. Now that boy, Uzumaki 
Naruto, has grown up to be a ninja-in-training, learning 
the art of ninjutsu with his cellmates Sakura and Sasuke. 











Naruto and company take on the Chinin Selection Exams 
but suffer a sudden attack from Orochimaru in the Forest 
of Death. Orochimaru leaves a curse mark on Sasuke’s body 
and vanishes, only to return during the final round to launch 
Operation Destroy Konoha! While Naruto battles Gaara, 

the Third Hokage falls to Orochimaru. 












After the funeral, the mysterious Tsunade becomes Fifth 
Hokage. Sasuke flees Konohagakure with the Sound Ninja 
Four. Shikamaru and a cell hurry to pursue Sasuke, but Choji 
and then Neji are struck down by the Sound Ninja. Can 

Sasuke be saved from himself?!

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY: A STORY TOO EMBARRASSING 
TO WRITE DOWN, FART | 


IT’S ABOUT TIME I ENDED WRITING MY PERSONAL HISTORY, 
BUT I'VE GOT NOTHING TO FILL OUT THIS BLANK FAGE WITH, 
SO I DECIDED TO CONTINUE WRITING ALITTLE BIT MORE. 
IT SEEMS THE MORE IWRITE, THE MORE I EMBARRASS 
MYSELF... BUT, I'M GOING TO WRITE AGAIN ANYWAY, AGAINST 
MY BETTER JUDGMENT. FIRST OF ALL, THIS STORY IS SO 
POINTLESS ANDO SILLY THAT I'VE AVOIDED WRITING IT UNTIL 
NOW, ANDO I'M NOT REALLY GUNG-HO ON WRITING IT NOW 
EITHER. BUT, AGAINST... MY...BETTER... JUDGMENT... 


I THINK IT WAS WHEN I WAS IN THE FIRST GRADE. IWAS 

SO INTO THIS ONE SENTAI, SFX ACTION/ADVENTURE HERO 
SERIES. THE ONE I PLAYED MOST OFTEN AT THAT AGE 
WAS TAIYO SENTAI SAN BARUKAN (SOLAR SQUADRON SUN 
VULCAN). I USED TO PLAY SUN VULCAN FIGHTERS WITH MY 
FRIEND AND MY TWIN BROTHER A LOT. SUN VULCAN WAS A BIT 
DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER SENTAI SERIES. WHILE MOST 
SENTAI SERIES HEROES WERE MADE UP OF A CELL OF FIVE, 
SUN VULCAN WAS BRAVE ENOUGH TO SAVE THE EARTH WITH 
A CELL OF THREE. THE CELL CONSISTED OF VULEAGLE, 
VULSHARK AND VULFANTHER. 


I'VE NEVER LIKED BEING THE LEADER, EVER SINCE IWASA 
KIO. SO I DECIDED TO PLAY THE ROLES OF EITHER VULSHARK 
OR VULFANTHER, THE SECOND OR THIRO RANKED GUYS, BUT, 
BECAUSE VULSHARK’S POSE LOOKED LAME TO ME, EVEN AT 
THAT AGE, I DECIDED TO GO WITH VULFANTHER. ...ANYWAY... 
WELL... UMM... I REALLY GOT INTO THE VULFANTHER 
CHARACTER. OR, IT WAS MORE LIKE... I ALREADY WAS 
VULFANTHER. BASICALLY, I WAS INTOXICATED WITH 
VULFANTHER. HOW MUCH SO...? TO BE CONTINUED... 


P.S. THE TRUTH SHALL BE REVEALED!

THERE'S

WAY TO 
READ YOUR 
COMMAND 
PATTERNS. 





I WASN'T 
LISTENING 
TO THE 


THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY: A STORY TOO EMBARRASSING 
TO WRITE DOWN, FART 2 


FOR THE ALMOST ONE YEAR I DECIDED TO IDENTIFY MYSELF 
WITH VULFANTHER, I ENCOUNTERED MANY DIFFICULTIES. 
VULFANTHER |S YELLOW. BOTTOM LINE, HE’S SYVBOLIZED 

BY THE COLOR YELLOW! SO, WHENEVER I HAD TO CHOOSE 

A COLOR, I CHOSE YELLOW! ANYTHING ANO EVERYTHING 
HAD TO BE YELLOW! 


VULFANTHER WORE A YELLOW JACKET SO, OF COURSE, 
I WORE YELLOW CLOTHES. BUT... THE YELLOW CLOTHES 
LOOKED WORSE THAN I THOUGHT. 


VULFANTHER IS (SYVBOLIZED BY) CURRY. BOTTOM LINE, HE 
LOVES CURRY AND RICE! SO, EVERY TIME SOMEONE ASKED 
ME, “WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE FOOO?” OF COURSE I 
ANSWERED “CURRY AND RICE!” ... FOR SOME REASON, 

IN THIS KIND OF SENTAI SERIES, MANY CHARACTERS WHOSE 
SYVBOLIC COLOR WAS YELLOW LIKED CURRY AND RICE. 

THE YELLOW RANGER OF THE GO RANGERS (MIGHTY 
MORPHIN POWER RANGERS IN ENGLISH) WAS NO EXCEPTION. 


VULFANTHER IS A CHARACTER THAT EATS TONS OF CURRY 
AND RICE AND ALWAYS ASKS FOR SECONDS. HE PILES UP 
PLATES ONE AFTER ANOTHER, EATING AS FAST AS WANKO 
SOBA SPEED-EATERS. AS FAR AS I CAN REMEMBER, HE 
WOULD PILE UP ABOUT 20 PLATES. BASICALLY, ONE LOOK AT 
HIM REVEALED CLEARLY THAT HE LOVED CURRY ANDO RICE, 


SO YOU CAN IMAGINE HOW EXCITED I GOT ON DAYS WHEN 
CURRY AND RICE WAS SERVED FOR DINNER!! A WANNABE 
VULPANTHER DEFINITELY HAD TO ASK FOR SECONDS NO 
MATTER WHAT, EVEN WHEN HE FELT LIKE THROWING UP OR 
THAT HIS STOMACH WAS GOING TO BURST. THEN I WOULD 
SAY TO MY MOTHER, “SECONDS, PLEASE! NEXT PLATE!” 

MY MOTHER WOLLDO SAY, “...? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?! 
IF YOU WANT SECONDS, PUT IT ON THE SAME PLATE YOU 
HAVE NOW!! NO NEED TO DIRTY ANOTHER PLATE!!” 

I THOUGHT, “...CAN’T ARGUE WITH THAT...” 


VULFANTHER ALSO CLIMBS WALLS. HE HAS SHARP CLAWS 
AND CAN CLIMB NO MATTER WHAT, EVEN IF THE WALL IS 
PERPENDICULAR TO THE GROUND! OF COURSE, I HAD TO 
CLIMB ANY PERPENDICULAR WALL I SAW WHEN PLAYING SUN 
VULCAN. ...EVEN I, AS AFIRST GRADER, KNEW THAT NO ONE 
COULD CLIMB A PERPENDICULAR WALL. BUT, IN FRONT OF 
VULEAGLE AND VULSHARK, I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO GO FOR 
IT. AS I RAN TOWARD THE WALL, I THOUGHT, “...HONESTLY, 
PLAYING VULFANTHER IS TOUGH...” JUMP!! ANDO SPLAT, 

I FLATTENED MYSELF AGAINST THAT WALL! SCRATCH! 
“OUCH!!!” ... WY FINGERNAILS GOT TORN OFF. 

«FROM THAT DAY FORWARD, I QUIT PLAYING VULFANTHER.
