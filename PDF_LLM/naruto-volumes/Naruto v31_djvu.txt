Masashiikishimotoy 





Recently | carelessly plucked 
a wart off of my upper arm. 
Gouging it out left that part 


of my skin damaged with a 
depression in it. The whole 


& thing left me with a different 
y kind of depression. 
—Masashi Kishitnoto, 2005 
eA AR 


Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

Naruto, the biggest troublemaker at the Ninja 
Academy in the village of Konohagakure, finally 
becomes a ninja along with his classmates, Sasuke 
and Sakura. During the Chinin Selection Exams, 
Orochimaru and his henchmen launch Operation 
Destroy Konoha. Naruto’s mentor, the Third 
Hokage, sacrifices his own life to stop the attack, 
and Tsunade becomes the Fifth Hokage. Lured by 
Orochimaru, Sasuke leaves Konohagakure. Naruto 
fights valiantly against Sasuke, but cannot stop his 
friend from following the path of darkness... 








Two years pass, and Naruto and his comrades 
grow up and undergo separate training programs, 
until Gaara falls into the hands of the Akatsuki. 
Naruto charges into the enemy’s lair to rescue 
Gaara, but Deidara stops him. Sakura and Granny 
Chiyo remain in the cave locked in battle with 
Sasori!!

GRATITUDE FOR FAN MAIL 


THANKS, EVERYONE, VERY MUCH FOR ALL YOUR 
FAN MAIL. I ALWAYS CREATE MY MANGA IN MY 
ROOM, NEVER KNOWING HOW READERS FEEL 
ABOUT IT. SO, BECAUSE FAN MAIL IS THE ONLY 
WAY I CAN COMMUNICATE WITH MY READERS, 
I’M REALLY HAPPY TO RECEIVE YOUR LETTERS. 
I READ YOUR LETTERS WHENEVER I HAVE TIME. 
SOME PEOPLE DOUBT WHETHER I REALLY 
READ THEM OR NOT, ANDO WANT ME TO PROVE 
THAT I 00. BUT DON’T WORRY. I REALLY AM 
READING THEM. I WISH I COULD WRITE BACK. 
HOWEVER, I RECEIVE SO MUCH THAT IF I 
WROTE BACK, I WOULON'T HAVE TIME LEFT TO 
DO MY MANGA. THAT’S NOT THE WAY I’O LIKE IT, 
BUT IWANT TO MAKE UP FOR NOT REPLYING 
AND SHOW MY GRATITUDE BY CREATING MORE 
AND MORE INTERESTING MANGA. AFTER ALL, 
IF MY MANGA ISN'T INTERESTING, YOU'LL STOP 
SENDING FAN MAIL (LAUGH). FOR THOSE OF 
YOU WHO WROTE TO ME, I'LL KEEP TRYING TO 
CREATE MANGA THAT YOU'LL ENJOY! 


I HOPE YOU'LL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT 
NARUTO!
