Can you believe itP! 

Rock Lee has become a main 
character! 

Rock Lee & His Ninja Pals’! (by 
Kenji Taira) is being simultaneously 
released with this volume*!! Rock 
Lee is fundamentally a youthful gag 
manga that revolves around Lee, 
but we're also aiming for a comedic 
touch and to dig further where all 
of you Naruto fans wished we'd 
a gone before... A-ha ha/! In any 
case, congrats, Lee/! 





— Masashi Kishimoto, 2012 


You can watch the anime, Naruto Spin-Off: Rock Lee & 
His Nira Pals now at vizanime.com! 


Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

THE STORY SO FAR... 


Naruto, the biggest troublemaker at the Ninja Academy in the Village of Kono- 
hagakure, finally becomes a ninja along with his classmates Sasuke and Sakura. 
They grow and mature through countless trials and battles. However, Sasuke, 
unable to give up his quest for vengeance, leaves Konohagakure to seek 
Orochimaru and his power. 

Two years pass. Naruto grows up and engages in fierce battles against the Tailed 
Beast-targeting Akatsuki. Elsewhere, after winning the heroic battle against Itachi 
and learning his older brother’s true intentions, Sasuke allies with the Akatsuki 
and sets out to destroy Konoha. 

Upon Madara of the Akatsuki's declaration of war against the Ninja Alliances, 
the Five Kage put together an Allied Shinobi Force. The Fourth Great Ninja War 
against the Akatsuki begins. Upon breaking out of the training grounds and rush- 
ing forth to each battleground, Naruto helps his comrades successfully seal away 
the previous Raikage, who had been called up through Edotensei, a method of 
using dead ninja, reanimated as soldiers. Now Gaara, leader of the Sand Village, 
and Ohnoki, leader of the Stone Village, battle the previous Mizukage, former 
leaders of the Mist Village!
