—WMasashi Kishimoto, 2011 


Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

THE STORY SO FAR... 





Naruto, the biggest troublemaker at the Ninja Academy in the Village of Kono- 
hagakure, finally becomes a full-fledged ninja. With his classmates Sasuke and 
Sakura, he endures countless trials and battles, growing ever stronger. However, 
Sasuke, unable to give up his quest for vengeance for the death of his family, 
leaves Konoha to seek out the rogue ninja Orochimaru, who he believes will 
give him great power. 

As two years pass, Naruto battles the Tailed Beast-targeting Akatsuki organiza- 
tion while Sasuke triumphs over his murderous brother, Itachi. But new intel 
sets Sasuke, now aligned with the Akatsuki, on a new mission of revenge, this 
time against the village of Konoha itself. 

Madara of the Akatsuki declares war on the Five Great Nations, prompting the 
Gokage, the five great leaders, to create an Allied Shinobi Force. The Fourth 
Great Ninja War begins. The Allied Forces confront an army of resurrected 


dead heroes and Naruto, still in the midst of training, attempts to sneak out and 
join the fray.
