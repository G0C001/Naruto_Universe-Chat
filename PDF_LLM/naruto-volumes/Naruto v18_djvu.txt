LOIN NEL ELLA INIA 


Story & Art by 


Masashi Kishimoto wate 





Recently, my shoulder pain has 
been getting worse...And it seems 
to always be my left shoulder. Why 
does my left shoulder get stiff 
when I'm right-handed? It's one of 
the Seven Great Mysteries of 
Kishimoto. 


—Mesashi Kishitoto, 2003 





Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

J Twelve years ago a destructive nine-tailed fox spirit 

attacked the ninja village of Konohagakure. The 
Hokage, or village champion, defeated the fox by 
sealing its soul into the body of a baby boy. Now that 
boy, Uzumaki Naruto, has grown up to be a ninja-in- 
training, learning the art of ninjutsu with his team- 

mates Sakura and Sasuke. 








Naruto and company take on the Chinin Selection 
Exams but suffer a sudden attack from Orochimaru in 
the Forest of Death. Orochimaru leaves a curse mark 
on Sasuke's body and vanishes, only to return during 

the final rounds to launch Operation Destroy Konoha! 








While Naruto battles Gaara, the Third Hokage falls 
to Orochimaru. But Konohagakure is saved and Jiraiya 
and Naruto set out to hunt down the future Fifth 
Hokage, Tsunade. On the way, they encounter Itachi, 
Sasuke's demented older brother...

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, FART 27-A 


S50 | HAD FINALLY WON WEEKLY SHONEN JUMP’'S NEWCOMER'S 
AWARD, WHICH HAD BEEN MY DEAREST DESIRE, AND TOOK ONE 
GIANT LEAP FORWARD TOWARD BECOMING A PROFESSIONAL 
MANGA ARTIST. | WAS ASSIGNED A PERSONAL EDITOR AND | 
RECEIVED 200,000 YEN (ABOUT 52,000) IN PRIZE MONEY, SO | WAS 
FLOATING ON AIR, FIRST, | DECIDED TO PUT ASIDE AND SAVE THE 
ENTIRE AMOUNT OF THE PRIZE PURSE. AT THE TIME, | WAS THE 
PROVERBIAL STARVING STUDENT ARTIST WHO HAD SO LITTLE MONEY 
THAT | WOULD SQUEEZE OUT AND USE EVERY LAST DROP OF FAINT 
IN THE TUBE. 


IN PARTICULAR, MY FAVORITE COBALT BLUE OIL PAINT... THAT SURE 
WAS EXPENSIVE! IF | REMEMBER CORRECTLY, EACH TUBE COST 
ABOUT 2,000 YEN (ABOUT $20)... 


BECAUSE THE SUPER-FRUGAL ME WOULD MAKE THE COBALT BLUE 
GO FURTHER BY THINNING IT WITH ADDITIONAL OIL, THERE STARTED 
TO BE A REAL DIFFERENCE IN COLOR DENSITY BETWEEN MY 
PAINTINGS AND THOSE OF MY BOURGEOIS CLASSMATES WHO JUST 
SLATHERED IT ON. IT GOT TO A POINT WHERE MY ART INSTRUCTOR 
WOULD REGULARLY SCOLO ME, “TOO LIGHT!" OR "YOU NEED TO GWE 
ITA HEAVIER, MORE OPPRESSIVE FEELING, YATTA YATTA." ON TOP OF 
IT ALL, HE'D SAY, "ARE YOU SLACKING?" OR "YOU OUGHT TO TAKE 
MORE TIME WITH IT, AND USE MANY MORE COLORS. YOU DON'T HAVE 
ENOUGH COLORS!" THAT INSTRUCTOR DEFINITELY DION'T TAKE HIS 
STUDENTS' WALLET CONTENTS INTO CONSIDERATION... 


| WANTED TO SHOUT BACK, | CAN'T HELP IT IF | CAN'T AFFORD MORE 
FAINT TUBES! BUT ACTUALLY, AT THAT POINT | DION'T REALLY CARE 
ANYMORE...THAT'S BECAUSE THE CONSTANTLY MONEY-GOBBLING 
OIL PAINTING BUSINESS HAD LOST ITS APPEAL, AND | WAS ALSO 
TIREO OF THE WHINING, HIGH-NOSEOD ART WORLD. I'0 RATHER SPEND 
WHAT PRECIOUS MONEY | HAD ON THE MOVIES, WHICH MIGHT HELP 
ME DRAW MANGA... ANO THUS, | DECIDED TO SPEND ALL MY MONEY 
ON MOVIES ANO VIDEOS.

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, PART 27-B 


| LIKE OIL FAINTING, DON'T GET ME WRONG, BUT WHAT | LEARNED 
IN COLLEGE WAS FINE ART, SOIT WAS PRETTY USELESS. | WAS 
TAUGHT THAT ONE SHOULD CREATE WHATEVER ONE FELT LIKE, 
EXPRESSING SOMETHING THAT WAS INSIDE ONESELF IN A WAY 
THAT IT COULD BE APPRECIATED BY THE VIEWER, ANDO YET IT 
SEEMED TO ME THAT MOST WORKS WERE SO ABSTRACT THAT 
THE VIEWER HAD TO RELY ON THE TITLE OR THE ACCOMPANYING 
BLURB, AND NOT ON THE PIECE ALONE, ONCE, MY INSTRUCTOR 
BROUGHT IN PHOTOS OF OILS HE HAD PAINTED HIMSELF, AND WAS 
BOASTING ABOUT HIS SOLO EXHIBITIONS AND HOW HE HAD SOLD 
HIS ART, BUT ALL | COULD THINK TO MYSELF WAS "IF YOU WANT 
YOUR STUFF TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED MORE, BE A BETTER 
ENTREPRENEUR!" IT WAS ALWAYS INSTRUCTORS LIKE HIM THAT 
WOLLD RIDICULE MANGA, AND TRY TO IMPOSE A RANKING SYSTEM 
UPON THE ART WORLD, THEY WHO ELEVATED FINE ART AND 
DENIGRATED ENTERTAINMENT WERE THE ONES WHO WANTED TO 
SELL THEIR OWN WORK OR BE ACKNOWLEDGED THE MOST. | 
THINK IF THEY REALLY WANT TO CREATE FINE ART, THEY SHOULD 
AIM FOR SELF-SATISFACTION. BECAUSE WORKS THAT THEY FAINT 
HOPING TO RELAY AND EXPRESS THEIR EGO, NO MATTER IF THEY 
FIT WITHIN THE REALM OF FINE ART, ONCE THEY DECIDE THEY 
WANT TO MAKE A LIVING FROM SELLING SUCH WORKS, THEY'VE 
ALREADY MOVED IN THE DIRECTION OF ENTERTAINMENT. 


THE WORKS OF THOSE WHO WANT TO MAKE A LIVING AS 
FAINTERS BUT WHO CAN'T LIVE OFF OF THE SALE OF THEIR 
PAINTINGS SO RELUCTANTLY FIND EMPLOYMENT AS ART 
TEACHERS AND DENIGRATE MANGA (|.E. ENTERTAINMENT) ARE 
THE LOWEST FORM OF ENTERTAINMENT. 


| THINK MANGA IS AN AMAZING MEDIUM BECAUSE NOT ONLY IS IT 
LOW-COST IN TERMS OF PRODUCTION, DEPENDING ONLY ON INK 
PRICES, BUT IT IS HIGH-QUALITY ENTERTAINMENT WHERE IT IS 
EASY TO CONVEY ONE'S SELF-EXPRESSION THROUGH THE USE OF 
DIALOGUE, STORYBOARDING, AND CHARACTERS. 


..| LOVE FINE ART, OON'T GET ME WRONG. AND | REALLY ADMIRE 
THOSE WHO PRODUCE FINE ART. IT'S JUST THAT | AM WARY OF 
THOSE ARTISTS WHO TRY TO JUOGE FINE ART AGAINST 
ENTERTAINMENT. IT IS THOSE ARTISTS WHO ARE NEITHER 
ARTISTS NOR ENTERTAINERS, BUT JUST PLAIN CRUD. Y 


suHUH, | HADN'T REALLY INTENDED TO WRITE ABOUT THIS... BUT | 
GUESS OLD RAGE DIES HARD...A-HA-HA.

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, PART 28 


RECENTLY, ALL SORTS OF THINGS ARE BECOMING DIGITIZED. THE 
NARUTO COMICS ARE APFARENTLY THE FIRST COMIC BOOK SERIES 
THAT IS EDITED DIGITALLY. 


WHEN | WAS A COLLEGE STUDENT, THERE WAS A FARTICULAR MUSIC 
VIDEO THAT | REALLY GOT HOOKED ON. IT WAS KEN ISHII'S MUSIC 
VIDEO, EXTRA. IT CONTAINS THE WORK OF ONE OF MY FAVORITE 
ANIMATORS, MR. KOJ| MORIMOTO. THE VIDEO WAS SHOWN OVER 
ANO OVER ON MTV, AND GOT BIG ENOUGH THAT IT EVEN BECAME A 
CONVERSATION TOPIC AMONG MY COLLEGE FRIENDS. PRETTY 
AWESOME, THEY'D SAY! 


| HAD SOMEHOW HEARD THAT IT WAS AN ANIME VIDEO PRODUCED BY 
A JAPANESE ANIMATOR, BUT UNTIL | ACTUALLY WATCHED IT, IT DIDN'T 
QUITE HIT ME. BUT THEN, | WAS STRUCK WHEN | DID! | GOT SUCKED 
INTO IT SO MUCH THAT | PLAYED HOOKY FROM SCHOOL AND SAT AT 
HOME WATCHING IT ALL DAY. THE REASON WHY | GOT SO HOOKED 
WAS BECAUSE | HAD NEVER SEEN SUCH MIND-BLOWING IMAGES 
BEFORE! TO USE A MORE CURRENT REFERENCE, IT WAS AN IMPACT 
LIKE THE SLO-MO FLYING BULLET SEQUENCE IN THE MATRIX. 


FIRST, EVEN THOUGH THE SUBJECT CHARACTERS AND PERSPECTIVE 
KEEP RAPIDLY CHANGING, THE BACKGROUND SHIFTS ACCORDINGLY 
AND IN SYNC. AND THE NARROW SENSE OF SFACE AND DEPTH WAS 
SO REALISTIC. AT FIRST | WONDERED, HOW DID HE DO THIS? BUT 
BECAUSE | KNEW HE COULDN'T HAVE DRAWN THE BACKGROUNDS BY 
HAND, | REALIZED THAT HE MUST HAVE DIGITALLY RENDERED IT 
USING A COMPUTER OR SOMETHING AND THEN ADDED THE 
BACKGROUNDS AS TEXTURE LAYERS... HEARD THEY DID THAT WITH 
GAMES LIKE VIRTUA FIGHTER 2, TOO...SUCH WERE THE GEEKY 
CONVERSATIONS | WAS HAVING. 


NOW THAT ANIME HAS ENTERED THE DIGITAL AGE AS WELL, SUCH 
MOVING BACKGROUNDS ARE NO LONGER NOVELTIES. IN FACT, 
THERE ARE WORKS NOW WHERE EVEN THE CHARACTERS ARE 
RENDERED FROM POLYGONS AND ONE NO LONGER HAS TO DRAW 
EACH CELL INDIVIDUALLY. JUST...WHEN ONE USES THE COMPUTER, 
THE LINES ARE TOO CLEAN... IT KIND OF LOSES ALITTLE OF THE 
ENERGY... OR EMOTIONAL IMPACT, SOMETHING LIKE THAT... | FEEL 
LIKE SOME OF THE NICE PARTS OF HAND DRAWING HAVE 
DISAPPEARED (ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF THE CHARACTERS). 


| WISH THIS FEEL-GOOD STUFF COULD BE EXPRESSED BY THE 
COMPUTER AS WELL; THAT WOULD MAKE THINGS PERFECT... IT 
SEEMS LIKE MANGA ARE ALSO GETTING MORE AND MORE 
DIGITIZED, BUT | WONDER IF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY STILL COSTS 
TOO MUCH TIME AND MONEY...?

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, FART 29 


| FEEL LIKE | GEEKED TOO MUCH IN MY PERSONAL HISTORY FARTS 27 
AND 28, SO | THINK ILL WRITE AN EMOTIONAL STORY THIS TIME. 


IN ANY CASE, IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING MY MANGA KARAKURI 
WINNING THE HOP 3X STEP AWARD, MY ASSIGNED EDITOR MR. YAHAG! 
ASKED ME TO DRAW A DRAFT (KIND OF A ROUGH SKETCH OF A 
MANGA) OF A STAND-ALONE STORY. WHEN HE SAW WANDERING 
DETOUR, THE BIG MISTAKE OF A MANGA THAT | JUST DREW WILLY- 
NILLY, MR. YAHAGI SIMPLY SAID, THIS...ISN'T SHONEN MAGAZINE 
MATERIAL! A-HA-HA-HA. AND | WAS THE MASOCHISTIC NEWBIE WHO 
REPLIED, SO IT'S A REJECT... HUH ACTUALLY REVELING IN THE 
REVERBERATION OF THE WORD REJECTION AND EVEN HAPPILY 
SELF-PROCLAIMING THAT IT WAS A REJECT (SEE VOLUME 4, FAGE 
26'S KISHIMOTO MASASHI'S FIRST MANGA REJECT SPECIAL). 


LATER ON, MR. YAHAG! ENCOURAGED ME WITH WHY DON'T YOU DRAW 
A MORE SHONEN-STYLE BATTLE EPIC! SO | EQUALLY EAGERLY 
REPLIED, RIGHT! AND WANTING TO MEET MR. YAHAGI'S 
EXPECTATIONS, | IMMEDIATELY SET OUT TO THINK UP A NEW VERSION 
OF MY WINNING WORK, KARAKURI. OF COURSE THE STORY OF AN 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL KID AND HIS MISADVENTURES ON THE WAY 
HOME FROM SCHOOL ISN'T ENTERTAINING! WHAT A FOOL | HAD 
BEEN! | HADN'T UNDERSTOOD ANYTHING! AND THE REGRET WENT 
ON... SO | QUICKLY DREW AN ALTERNATE VERSION OF KARAKURI AND 
MAILEOITIN...THIS TIME, FOR SURE... 


MR. YAHAGI SIMPLY SAID, ER...| DON'T UNDERSTAND IT AT ALL! A-HA- 
HA-HA. SO AGAIN, | SELF-PROFESSED, .. WHICH MEANS...IT'S 
REJECTED, RIGHT...AND ONCE AGAIN, | HADN'T MET MR. YAHAGI'S 
EXPECTATIONS, ..., THIS TIME, | LOST MY EAGERNESS, | BECAME 
QUITE DEPRESSED IN FACT. ...REALITY IS HARSH. ... THEN ONE DAY, | 
RECEIVED A LETTER FROM MR. YAHAGI. WHEN | EXAMINED IT, | 
REALIZED IT CONTAINED TWO FULL FAGES OF POINTERS ABOUT 
HOW TO DRAW MANGA AND OTHER ADVICE. AND, WHEN | GOT TO THE 
ENO OF THAT LETTER...MY EYES STARTED WELLING A BIT WITH 
TEARS. HERE'S WHAT IT SAID... 


"YOU DO HAVE TALENT. PLEASE KEEP TRYING." 


EVEN IF IT WERE A LIE OR FLATTERY, IT STILL MADE ME HAPPY! | HAD 
BEEN DEPRESSED, BUT IT RENEWED MY DETERMINATION! 
IMMEDIATELY, | STARTED DRAWING A DRAFT. AND THEN, WHEN | 
FOUND OUT THAT MR. YAHAG! HIMSELF WAS PLANNING TO FAY ME A 
PERSONAL VISIT TO MY HOUSE (IN KYUSHU) TO GO OVER IT, | PUT 
GREAT DRIVE INTO MY DRAFT, AND WENT TO MEET MR, YAHAGI AT MY 
LOCAL MISTER DONUT. I'M NOT GOING TO WASTE THOSE TEARS | 
SHED, | SWORE TO MYSELF! | PUT GREAT ENERGY INTO THIS DRAFT! 
THIS TIME FOR SURE! 


HE TOOK A LOOK AT THE MANGA, THEN UTTERED, "THIS ISN'T REALLY 
MANGA..." 


| DION'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY ANYMORE...SINCE THEN, I'VE GOTTEN 
DEPRESSED COUNTLESS TIMES, BUT EACH TIME | WOULD PULL OUT 
THAT LETTER AND REREAD IT TO THE END AGAIN...|T'S A PRECIOUS 
LETTER THAT | STILL PEEK AT FROM TIME TO TIME EVEN NOw.
