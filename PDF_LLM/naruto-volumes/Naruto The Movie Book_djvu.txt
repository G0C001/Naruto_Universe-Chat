HAA —Masashi Kishimoto, 2015 


Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

THE PEOPLE OF 
KONOHAGAKURE VILLAGE 


OLNWOT DIKWAZAY 





MM CHE STORY So FAR... 


Naruto, the biggest troublemaker at the Ninja Academy in the village of 
Konohagakure, becomes a ninja along with his classmates Sasuke and Sakura. 
They grow and mature through countless trials and battles. However, Sasuke, 
unable to give up his quest for vengeance, leaves Konohagakure to seek 
Orochimaru and his power. 

Two years pass. Naruto grows up and engages in fierce battles against the 
Tailed Beast-targeting Akatsuki, and the Fourth Great Ninja War against them 
begins. At the end of the fierce battle, Naruto joins forces with Sasuke and 


succeeds in sealing away the resurrected rabbit goddess Kaguya. 

Time passes, and the people rejoice in the peace that has come to be. 
While at a loss about his son Boruto’s pranks, Naruto works hard for his 
village as the Seventh Hokage. Meanwhile, the Ninja Academy’s graduation 
examination draws near...
