Story & Art by 





I've recently starting going out 

to eat with my assistants after 
work. Once we get our drinks | 
always end up leading the toast... 
but my assistants’ eyes seem 

to be stating that simply saying 
“shanks for your hard work today” 
is somewhat insufficient... Ah, but 
there ain't much variation that can 
be had there/// 





—Masashi Kishimoto, 2013 





Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

THE STORY SO FAR... 

Naruto, the biggest troublemaker at the Ninja Academy in the Village of 
Konohagakure, finally becomes a ninja along with his classmates Sasuke and 
Sakura. They grow and mature through countless trials and battles. 
However, Sasuke, unable to give up his quest for vengeance, leaves 
Konohagakure to seek Orochimaru and his power... 

Two years pass. Naruto grows up and engages in fierce battles against the 
Tailed Beast-targeting Akatsuki. Elsewhere, after winning the heroic battle 
against Itachi and learning his older brother's true intentions, Sasuke allies 
with the Akatsuki and sets out to destroy Konoha. 

The Fourth Great Ninja War against the Akatsuki begins. Having stopped 
the Edotensei jutsu with the help of his brother, Sasuke now heads off with 
Orochimaru to fullfil a new objective. Meanwhile, Naruto and his allies try 
to stop Obito and Madara from reviving Ten Tails. And what will Sasuke's 
next move be?!
