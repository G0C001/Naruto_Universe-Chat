—Masashi Kishimoto, 2002 


Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in |997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

THE STORY SO FAR... 


Twelve years ago, a destructive nine-tailed fox spirit attacked the ninja village of Konohagakure. The 
Hokage, or village champion, defeated the fox by sealing its soul into the body of a baby boy. Now 
that boy, Uzumaki Naruto, has grown up to become a ninja-in-training, learning the art of ninjutsu with 
his teammates Sakura and Sasuke. 


Nine candidates — including Naruto and Sasuke — have made it past the preliminary rounds of 
the third Chanin Exam, and they begin a month-long period of preparation for the finals. 
Meanwhile, Orochimaru orders Kabuto to kidnap Sasuke...but Kakashi catches Kabuto in the 
act. Although Sasuke is safe, Kabuto escapes — but not before his true identity is revealed. Now 
training with elite tutor Ebisu, Naruto practices a water-walking exercise at the local hot spring, 
But when a peeping tom and a giant toad knock out his instructor, what's Naruto to do?!

WN ig HOOK.” | ALSO COMBINED THE 
“SECOND HALF’S THEME AND PLOT 
‘ INTRODUCTIONS AS WELL TO MINIMIZE 
IM THE PAGE COUNT, BUT IT SEEMS THAT 
SUCH MANGA JUST DON'T FARE VERY 
et WELL... NEWCOMERS WHO DRAW THIS 
G@NSORT OF MANGA APPARENTLY NEED 
yTO BE EXCEPTIONALLY TALENTED IN 
(2) ORDER TO PULL IT OFF SUCCESSFULLY.

aT HIS WORLD ALREADY HAS BASTARD 
AND BERSERK, YOU KNOW?!” “OH, ALL 
RIGHT! | GIVE UP!” | THOUGHT TO 
MYSELF, AND PROMPTLY STOPPED 
WORKING ON IT. 


HOWEVER, WELL, | STILL RATHER LIKEO THE IDEA OF THIS “WAGIC MUSHROOM,” 
SO | ENTERTAINED THE THOUGHT OF DRAWING IT AGAIN SOME DAY, PERHAPS 
AFTER NARUTO ENDS, SO | WAS ORIGINALLY NOT PLANNING TO SUBMIT 

IT TO THE MANGA REJECT SPECIAL. BUT THEN WHY DID | BRING IT UP NOW, 
FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE VOLUME 4? BECAUSE | RECENTLY BECAME 
ACQUAINTED WITH THE NOVEL HARRY POTTER, AND SEEING HOW SIMILAR 

THE PREMISE AND STORY WERE TO IT, |’W LOATH TO BE CALLED A COPYCAT. SO | 
LOST INTEREST IN DRAWING IT, AND DECIDED TO SHOWCASE IT HERE.

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, FART [4 


ONCE | STARTED MY LAST YEAR OF JUNIOR HIGH, | HAD TO CONCENTRATE 
ON STUDYING FOR MY HIGH SCHOOL ENTRANCE EXAMS RATHER THAN 
ORAWING MANGA. THIS WAS BECAUSE, EVEN THOUGH | WAS VERY STUPID, | 
DECIDED TO APPLY TO A SCHOOL FOR HIGHLY MOTIVATED COLLEGE- 
BOUND STUDENTS. | THOUGHT | HAD STUDIED PRETTY HARD, BUT...1 WAS 
NAIVE! | FAILED THE ENTRANCE EXAM IN SPECTACULAR FASHION. | FELT 
TOTALLY DEFLATED. | HAD APPLIED TO A DIFFERENT HIGH SCHOOL ASA 
“SAFETY,” AND THEY ACCEPTED ME, SO | ENDED UP GOING THERE INSTEAD. 
BUT BY THAT POINT | PRETTY MUCH STOPPED STUDYING COMPLETELY 
BECAUSE | HAD DECIDED, “I'VE GOT TO START MAKING MY MOVE IF I'M GOING 
TO BECOME A MANGA ARTIST!” I KNEW ABOUT A BUNCH OF GUYS WHO HAD 
WON SHONEN JUMP’'S HOP STEP AWARD IN THEIRLATE TEENS, AND | HAD 
HEARD RUMORS THAT PLENTY OF SHOJO MANGA ARTISTS PUBLISHED 
THEIR FIRST COMICS BY THE TIME THEY ENTERED HIGH SCHOOL, SO | WAS 
SWEATING. IN MY FIRST YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL, | BOUGHT ASET OF MANGA 
ORAWING TOOLS, BUT EVERY TIME | TRIED TO DRAW A “NAME” FOR A STORY 
(AKINO OF SIMPLE ROUGH DRAFT OF PLOTLINES AND CHARACTERS), | JUST 
COULDN'T DO IT. I'0 JUST SIT THERE THINKING FOR FIVE HOURS (OR MORE!) 
ANO STILL BE UNABLE TO COME UP WITH A SINGLE PAGE... | FROZE UP AS IF 
I'0 SUDDENLY BEEN TURNED TO STONE. UNLIKE MY RANDOM DOODLING 
DAYS OF YORE, | NOW HAD TO COME UP WITH 3! FAGES TO MEET THE 
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE AWARD, AND THAT PROSPECT WAS JUST TOO 
DAUNTING. | COULON’T EVEN PINPOINT WHAT | WAS LACKING, BUT | WAS 
CONTINUALLY DEPRESSED ANO CONVINCED THAT I'D NEVER BECOME A 
MANGA ARTIST BECAUSE | COULDN'T THINK OF ANYTHING TO DRAW. THAT’S 
WHEN | HAD A STARTLING REALIZATION. “I’M IN BIG TROUBLE! AMANGA 
ARTIST NEEDS MORE THAN JUST DRAWING ABILITY... HE’S GOT TO BE ABLE 
TO COME UP WITH STORIES, TOO! | SHOULD HAVE FAID MORE ATTENTION 

IN LITERATURE CLASS. DARN IT!” NOW, WHEN | LOOK BACK, | WONDER WHY 
ON EARTH IT TOOK ME SOLONG TO REALIZE THAT! BUT AT THE TIME, | 
HONESTLY BELIEVED THAT ASLONG AS | COULD DRAW, | COULD BECOME 

A MANGA ARTIST. AS| SAID, | REALLY WAS THOROUGHLY STUPID.

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, FART IS 


SOMEHOW, WHEN | WAS A HIGH SCHOOL JUNIOR, | FINALLY MANAGED TO DRAW A 
3I-FAGE MANGA, BUT | COULON’T JUOGE WHETHER IT WAS FUNNY OR NOT, SO | 
ASKED MY LITTLE BROTHER TO READ IT. | WAITED, SILENTLY WILLING HIM TO FIND 
IT HILARIOUS, BUT WHEN HE FINALLY SPOKE, HE SAIO, “THIS ISN’T FUNNY AT ALL!” | 
DECIDED THAT | COULON'T TRUST HIS OPINION, SO NEXT | SHOWED IT TO OUR 
FATHER, BUT HIS REACTION WAS THE SAME... “IT'S NOT FUNNY!” | HAD BEEN ALL 
READY AND EXCITED TO SEND IN THAT FIRST 3I-FAGE MANGA TO THE SHONEN 
JUMP CONTEST. BUT AFTER THOSE TEPID RESPONSES, | COMPLETELY LOST 
MY NERVE, AND THAT REJECT MANGA ENDED UP BURIED IN MY DESK DRAWER 
FOREVER. 

| WAS A YOUNG, SIMPLEMINDED, BLINKERED FOOL WHO THOUGHT, “I WANT TO 
HURRY UP AND WIN THAT CONTEST, SO | SHOULO JUST KEEP DRAWING MANGA 
ANDO SENDING THEM IN!” | KNOW | USED TO BE A COMPLETE IDIOTIC BRAT, BUT... 
WELL, LOOKING BACK, THAT BRAINLESS PERSEVERANCE WAS PROBABLY A GOOD 
TRAIT TO DEVELOP. | REASON TO MYSELF THAT | COULON’T HELP IT BACK THEN 
BECAUSE | WAS AT THE HEIGHT OF MY YOUTH. 

| DREW MANY OTHER MANGA, BUT | KEPT BEING TOLO THEY WERE NOT FUNNY, SO 
AT ONE POINT | SNAPPEO AND SAID, ‘WHY AREN'T MY MANGA FUNNY?! OARN IT! 
WHAT'S SO DIFFERENT ABOUT THEM COMPARED TO OTHER MANGA ARTISTS’ 
WORK, HUH?!” | ENDED UP GRAQUATING HIGH SCHOOL WITHOUT HAVING MADE 
ANY PROGRESS ON THE MANGA FRONT. BUT BECAUSE | HAD BEEN SPENDING 
ALL MY TIME ATTEMPTING TO DRAW MANGA, MY GRADES WERE 38TH OUT OF 37 
IN MY CLASS. EVEN WITH REVIEW COURSES, IT BECAME CLEAR | WOULD NOT BE 
ACCEPTED TO ANY COLLEGE. SO | STANK AT CREATING MANGA, | STANK AT 
SCHOOL, AND OF COURSE MY ROMANTIC LIFE STANK, SO IT WASA TRIPLE 
WHAMMY OF HIGH SCHOOL BLUES, BUT | GUESS THAT HIGH SCHOOL IS A ROUGH 
PERIOD FOR EVERYONE. IT’S A TIME WHEN YOU'RE BESET ON ALL SIDES BY 
DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES (THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE CURRENTLY STUDENTS 
WILL UNDERSTAND). FATE WASN'T BEING VERY KINO (WELL, THAT'S USUALLY THE 
CASE). HOWEVER, | WAS UNDAUNTED... OR RATHER, | WASN'T THE TYPE TO THINK 
TOO DEEPLY ABOUT SUCH THINGS... | JUST KEPT THINKING, ‘WELL! I'LL MANAGE 
SOMEHOW.” AHH, | FEEL SO LUCKY THAT | WAS DUMB!
