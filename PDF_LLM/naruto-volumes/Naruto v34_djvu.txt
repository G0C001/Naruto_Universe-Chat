Recently, the people around me 
tell me they have been reading 
books. | rarely read books, so 
I'm thinking about picking one 
up for the first time in a while. 
I'm considering either a mystery 
or a fantasy work. 


—_Masashi Kishinroto, 2006 





Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

With the aftershocks of Operation: Destroy Konoha 
still reverberating throughout their elite shinobi corps, 
the new Team Kakashi, under the substitute leadership 
of Captain Yamato, and joined by the enigmatic, 
emotionless Sai, sets out on a mission to rescue 
Sasuke from Orochimaru. 


But their mission is soon jeopardized. First, by 
Orochimaru and his henchman, Kabuto... Then, by 


Naruto himself as he succumbs to the power of the 
Nine- Tailed Fox demon hidden inside him and goes 
on a rampage...And finally by Sai who is secretly 
working for Danzo, leader of the military organization 
The Foundation. 


But with Sai’s private picture book now in their 
possession, Naruto, Sakura and Yamato regroup in an 
attempt to unravel the secrets of Sai’s real mission...
