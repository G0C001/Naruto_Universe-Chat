“Masashi Kishimoto™ 





You know, there's something that | 
think is really confusing: The term 
“3-D" has been real popular lately, 
rightP But that word has existed for 
a long time, from back when video 
games, anime and movies first started 
using polygons and CG. But now, 3-D 
refers to three-dimensional images 
that appear to leap out at you, like 
3-D films or 3-D live animation. 
| mean, | understand...| really do 
understand... My only question is, what 
Should we now call what used to be called 3-DP 2.5-DP Or 
perhaps we should call the current stuff super-3DP 





—_Masashi Kishittroto, 2070 


Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

THE STORY SO FAR... 


Naruto, the biggest troublemaker at the Ninja Academy in the Village of 
Konohagakure, finally becomes a ninja. Along with his classmates Sasuke 
and Sakura, he grows and matures during countless trials and battles. 
Sasuke, unable to give up his quest for vengeance, leaves Konohagakure 
to seek the renegade ninja Orochimaru, from whom he hopes to gain 
immense power. 

Two years pass. Naruto battles against the Tailed Beast-targeting 
Akatsuki. Elsewhere, after winning the epic battle against his brother Itachi, 
Sasuke learns the truth about Itachi’s perceived betrayal of their clan. He 
allies with the Akatsuki and sets out to destroy Konoha. 

Sasuke invades the Gokage Summit convened to deal with the Akatsuki. 
Danzo manages to escape and Sasuke’s assault ends in failure, but after 
Madara declares war on the Shadow leaders, an Allied Shinobi Force is 
formed! Meanwhile, Sai reappears before Naruto, who is still confused by 
Sakura’s unexpected confession...
