ISHONENIUMEJMANGA 


Story & Art by 


Masashi Kishimoto wate 





I've recently been feeling the limits 
of expression in manga. With 
manga's particular style of reading 
from top right to bottom left, the 
order of dialogue severely limits the 
angle of the camera... Isn't there 
another way... 





—Masashi Kishitroto, 2003 


Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

EDA 


ae ell 





Twelve years ago a destructive nine-tailed fox spirit 
attacked the ninja village of Konohagakure. The Hokage, 
or village champion, defeated the fox by sealing its soul 
into the body of a baby boy. Now that boy, Uzumaki 
Naruto, has grown up to be a ninja-in-training, learning 
the art of ninjutsu with his teammates Sakura and 
Sasuke. 


Naruto and company take on the Chinin Selection 
Exams but suffer a sudden attack from Orochimaru in 
the Forest of Death. Orochimaru leaves a curse mark 
on Sasuke’s body and vanishes, only to return during 
the Exams to launch Operation Destroy Konoha! 


While Naruto battles Gaara, the Third Hokage falls 
to Orochimaru. But Konohagakure is saved and Jiraiya 
and Naruto set out to hunt down the future Fifth 
Hokage, Tsunade. On the way, they encounter Itachi, 
Sasuke’s demented older brother. And Tsunade has a 
strange encounter with Orochimaru, resulting in a battle| 
that ends in deadlock!
