—Masashl K/shinoto, ZOOG 





Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

Team Kakashi’s mission to rescue Uchiha Sasuke from 
the sinister Orochimaru continues! While Captain 
Yamato’s doppelganger searches for the villain’s secret 
hideout, Naruto and Sakura pore over Sai’s mysterious 
picture book and finally learn the truth about their 
treacherous teammate’s troubled origin... 


or 













Sai, meanwhile, remains in the company of Orochi- 
maru where he at last comes face to face with Sasuke. 
But the young man he meets bears little to no resem- 
blance to Naruto’s friend of the past. Gone are any 
traces of the light that was once inside him. All that 
remains is a being of darkness bent on destruction... 









Team Kakashi finally infiltrates Orochimaru’s lair and 
goes toe to toe with Sasuke. Now more powerful than 
ever, he leaves his former friends in the dust, picking up 
the pieces of their failed mission...
