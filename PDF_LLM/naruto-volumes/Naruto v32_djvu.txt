It's 2OOG. | believe the 
serialization began in 1999, so 
that means we've entered our 
seventh year of publication! Long 
enough for kids that were just 
entering elementary school to now 
be in junior high... | recently 
started noticing how it seems like 
the years pass quicker and 
quicker. Where in the world did 
the time goP! When in the world 
did | become middle-aged?! 
Yikes... 





—Masashi Kishitroto, 2OO6 


Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

THE SEARCH FOR SASUKE 


STORY AND ART BY 
MASASHI KISHIMOTO 


\ ‘ 
CHARACTERS 
















Naruto, the biggest troublemaker at the Ninja Academy in 
Konohagakure, finally becomes a ninja along with his classmates 
Sasuke and Sakura. During the Chinin Selection Exams, Orochi- 
maru and his henchmen launch Operation Destroy Konoha. To 

stop the attack and prevent the deaths of any more of Konoha’s 
shinobi, Sarutobi, the Third Hokage, sacrifices his own life. In the 
wake of this tragedy, Lady Tsunade is sought out and declared 

Fifth Hokage. 









| 






















Sasuke—lured by the Sound Ninja Four of Orochimaru—leaves 
Konohagakure. Naruto fights valiantly against Sasuke, but cannot 
stop his friend from following the possible path of darkness... 







After two years, Naruto and his comrades reunite, each having 
grown and matured in attitude and aptitude. Gaara of the Sand 
has become Kazekage, and falls into the hands of the mysterious 
organization known as the Akatsuki. 







After several fierce battles, Naruto and the others defeat rogue 
ninja Sasori and Deidara and recover Gaara. But their victory 
looks to be a bitter one as Gaara is dead. Or so it seems until 
Granny Chiyo, using a reincarnation jutsu, sacrifices her own life 
to resurrect the fallen Kazekage!
