—Masashi Kishitroto, 2007 





Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

HAR JOOE 














Naruto was once the bane of the Konohagakure Ninja 
Academy. Nevertheless, alongside his friends Sasuke and 
Sakura, he successfully joins the ranks of the ninja. 


During the Chunin Journeyman Ninja Selection Exam, 

| Orochimaru launches Operation Destroy Konoha. Lord 

| Hokage sacrifices his life to halt the attack; in the after- 

| math, Tsunade steps up to become the Fifth Hokage. 
Meanwhile, charmed by the power of Orochimaru, Sasuke 
| defeats Naruto and departs Konoha; struggle as he will, 

_ Naruto can do nothing to stop him. 


More than two years pass. Naruto and his friends un- 
dergo rigorous training. Yet when they finally catch up 
with Sasuke, his power overwhelms them. 


Determined to best Sasuke, Naruto returns for another 
round of intense training. Meanwhile, Shikamaru and the 
others violently clash with the Akatsuki group. Though 
the scene looks grim, Naruto arrives just in time to 
deliver his lethal attack...
