Oh man, it's spring! | always

—Masashi Kishitioto, 2004 





Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

Shik 
ieee R D 


Twelve years ago, a destructive nine-tailed fox spirit 
attacked the ninja village of Konohagakure. The Hokage, 
or village champion, defeated the fox by sealing its soul 
into the body of a baby boy. Now that boy, Uzumaki 
Naruto, has grown up to become a ninja-in-training, 
learning the art of ninjutsu with his teammates Sakura 
and Sasuke. During the Second Chdnin Exam, Naruto 
and the others were attacked by Orochimaru, who left 
a curse mark on Sasuke and vanished... 


Naruto and Sasuke proceeded to the Chdnin Exam 
Finals, but in the middle of the Sasuke vs. Gaara battle, 
Orochimaru and company launch Operation Destroy 
Konoha, which was stopped when the Third Hokage 
sacrificed his own life. 


Sasuke, healed by Tsunade, who has become the Fifth 
Hokage, leaves Konoha Village with the Sound Ninja 
Four... The quintet of Shikamaru, Naruto, Choji, Kiba, 
and Neji hastily set out after them...!
