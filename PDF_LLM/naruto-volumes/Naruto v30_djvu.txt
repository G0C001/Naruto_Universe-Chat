The movies and games coming 
out these days look so 
incredible it stuns me. I'm 
starting to suspect my readers 
are so used to rich imagery 
that manga must feel rather 
underwhelming by comparison. 
After all, it’s still published in 
black and white... Remember, 
though, that manga's strength 
is in its rapid production. So 
please overlook its weaknesses. 





—Masashi Kishitnoto, ZOOS 


Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

CHARACTERS [ 


















Naruto was once the bane of the Konohagakure 
Ninja Academy. Despite the rough start, he successfully 
joins the ranks of ninja along with Sasuke and Sakura. 
During the Chinin Exam, Orochimaru launches 
Operation Destroy Konoha, an attack thwarted by 

the Third Hokage’s sacrifice of his own life. After the 
battle, Tsunade steps up to become the Fifth Hokage. 
Lured by Orochimaru’s power, Sasuke leaves Konoha 
in the company of the Sound Ninja Four. Naruto 
confronts Sasuke, but no matter how hard he fights, 

he can’t stop his friend. 













More than two years pass. Naruto and his 
friends mature, each undergoing rigorous training. 
Gaara, who has become Kazekage, is suddenly 
kidnapped by the dark Akatsuki organization. 
Naruto and the gang set out for the Akatsuki 
hideaway on their way to rescue Gaara.

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
PERSONAL HISTORY: A TRIP ABROAD 


ALTHOUGH THE COLLEGE I ATTENDED WASN'T THAT 
AMAZING, IT DID OFFER AN OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT OVER- 
SEAS ART MUSEUMS. THE TRIP WASN'T MANDATORY OR ANY- 
THING, SO I WASN'T PLANNING TO SIGN UP. THERE SEEMED 
LITTLE POINT IN TRAVELING ABROAD JUST TO VISIT ART 
MUSEUMS. BESIDES, IT WAS SUPER EXPENSIVE. THERE WAS 
NO WAY I COULD SWING IT ON A PART-TIME JOB. STILL, MY 
FATHER INSISTED THAT I SHOULO GO, RATTLING ON ABOUT 
COLLEGE AND TREASURED MEMORIES. HE'D EVEN FAY FOR 
IT HIMSELF, HE SAIO, IF I HADN'T ACCEPTED, I MIGHT'VE GIVEN 
HIM A CONNIPTION. (AS A FATHER HE JUST HAD TO BITE THE 
BULLET. THERE'S NO WAY HE COULD TELL HIS SON IT WAS 
TOO EXPENSIVE TO GO.) 


THE TOUR BROUGHT US TO SFAIN ANO FRANCE. IN SFAIN, 
THERE WAS ONE MUSEUM I WAS PARTICULARLY LOOKING 
FORWARD TO SEEING. WHEN WE GOT THERE, THOUGH, THEY 
WOLLON'T LET US IN. THEY TOLD US THEY'O JUST FOUND A 
BAG CONTAINING EXPLOSIVES. SO ALL WE WOUND UP SEEING 
WAS ABOMB SQUAD. 


WHEN WE GOT TO FRANCE, I MADE A BEELINE FOR THE 
MONA LISA. I FIGURED, HEY, AFTER SPENDING SO MUCH 
MONEY ON THE TRIP, I SHOULD AT LEAST GET A GLIMPSE 
OF THE REAL MCCOY. THE FAINTING WAS SO POPULAR THAT 
IT HAD AMASSED AHUGE WALL OF PEOPLE, BLOCKING ANY 
VIEW. UNDAUNTED IN MY QUEST, I WAITED FOR AN OPENING. 
THE MOMENT A PERSON SHUFFLED AWAY, I OASHED FOR HIS 
PLACE. 'AH, SO THIS IS THE MONA LISA!" NOT THAT I KNEW 
ANYTHING ABOUT THE FAINTING, REALLY, BUT I STILL ACTED 
LIKE IT TOUCHED ME. 


AFTER A MOMENT OF GAWKING UP AT IT, I FELT THIS INTENSE 
PAIN ON MY CHEEK. "YOWCH!" FALLING TO THE GROUND, I 
REFLEXIVELY LOOKED BACK, ONLY TO SEE... AN OLD WOMAN. 
THIS WELL-BUILT, ELDERLY FOREIGN LADY, HER FIST STILL 
RETRACTING. AFIST! WELL, TWO GUESSES WHAT HAD 
STRUCK ME. I GUESS SHE NEEDED THIS Guy’S HEAD OUT OF 
THE WAY TO GET A BETTER VIEW. 


SO, WELL, IF I SUM UP MY TREASURED MEMORY OF THIS TRIP 
ABROAD, IT GOES LIKE THIS: BEING PUNCHED DOWN By A 
LITTLE OLD FOREIGN LADY RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE MONA 
LISA AFTER SPENDING ALOT OF MONEY TO SEE IT. THE OLD 
BIRD JUST STOOD THERE, TAKING SNAPSHOT AFTER SINAP- 
SHOT OF THE PAINTING, EVEN THOUGH CAMERAS WERE 
PROHIBITED. NO MATTER WHAT COUNTRY THEY'RE FROM, IT 
SEEMS OLD WOMEN ARE ALWAYS FRIGHTENING.
