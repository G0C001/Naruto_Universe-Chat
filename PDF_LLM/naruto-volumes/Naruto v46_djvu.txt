Masashi 





I'm trying to come up with the 
author's note for this volume right 
now, but | have a fever, so nothing's 
coming to mind... It’s been a while 
since I've been sick. Argh... | can't 
think of anything... 


—Masashi Kishirroto, 2O09 





Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

THE STORY SO FAR... 


Naruto, the biggest troublemaker at the Ninja Academy in the Village of 
Konohagakure, finally becomes a ninja along with his classmates Sasuke 
and Sakura. They grow and mature through countless trials and battles. 
However, Sasuke, unable to give up his quest for vengeance, leaves Kono- 
hagakure to seek Orochimaru and his power... 

Two years pass. Naruto and his comrades grow up and head out once 
more. As their fierce battles against the Tailed Beast-targeting Akatsuki 
rage on, Sasuke rebels against Orochimaru and takes everything from him. 
Sasuke then gathers new companions and chases after his brother Itachi. 
The heroic battle concludes with Sasuke fulfilling his long-cherished goal. 
But after learning of his older brother's true intentions, Sasuke allies with 
the Akatsuki and sets out to destroy Konoha! Naruto trains in senjutsu 
with Fukasaku at Mount Myoboku. Meanwhile, Pain finally begins his 
assault against Konoha in search of Naruto!

WHICH MEANS 
THE FAIN 
LORD JIRAIYA 
OEFEATED 
HAS BEEN 
RESURRECTED 


BODY. 


ANO IF 
THERE ARE 
RECEIVERS, 

THERE MUST 

BEA 

TRANSMITTER. 


IN A DIFFERENT 


«WITH 
THESE? 


THERE'S A 
POSSIBILITY 
THAT ALL 
THOSE 
BEARING 
IMPLANTED 
RECEIVERS 


ARE BODIES. 


THERE ARE 


ONE JUTSU 












SIX FAINS... 
ANDO EACH 
ONE CAN 
USE ONLY 


WAS SHE 
PIERCED 


PLUS, 


HE CAN 
SUBSTITUTE 
HIMSELF 
IN OTHER 
BODIES AT WILL, 
AND HE MAKES 
THEM MOVE BY 
IMPLANTING 
THESE BLACK 
CHAKRA 
RECEIVERS 
IN THEM. 








THAT 
PROVES 
LORD 
FUKASAKU'S 
HYPOTHESIS 
THAT FAIN 
HAS THE 
ABILITY TO 
REVIVE THE 


PROBABLY 
MEANS 
THAT THE 
TRANSMITTER 


IS NOT ONE 
OF THE 
SIX FAINS. 


.1O BE 
ABLE TO 
REMOTELY 
CONTROL 
THIS MANY 
BODIES 
THIS FREELY 
USING JUST 
THEIR 



























IT’S ABIT SIMILAR b 

ARE SIX OF TO OUR YAMANAKA 

THEM PAINS, CLAN’S MINO 

RIGHT...7 TRANSFER JUTSU, 

DOES THAT BUT WE'RE ONLY 

MEAN THERE ABLE TO MANIPULATE n+ 
ARE SIX IN THE ONE PERSON ATA I 





TIME WITH OUR 


IFIT’SA TRANSFER- 
TYPE JUTSU, THEY HAVE 
TO BE AS CLOSE TO 
THE RECEIVERS AS 
POSSIBLE TO TRANSMIT 
THEIR CHAKRA... SUCH 
COMPLEX JUTSU OR 
MOVEMENTS WOULD BE 
IMPOSSIBLE OTHERWISE.
