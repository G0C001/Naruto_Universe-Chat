We're in the third volume of 
Naruto. | feel like I've developed a 
lot working on this title, but | still 
have a long way to go. My heart 
and body are still weak! | must 
devote a mountain of training to

—Masashi Kishitmoto, Z0OO 


Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in |974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (“mechanism”). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

When Naruto was an infant, 
he was used as a living sacri- 
fice in a magic rite: a demonic 
fox spirit was sealed inside his 
body to keep it from wreaking 
havoc in the outside world. 
The orphan Naruto grew up 
to be an attention-seeking 
troublemaker. Despite the evil 
spirit inside him, he just wants 
to be the best ninja ever, and 
become the Hokage, the vil-

with Kakashi. 


THE STORY SO FAR... 

Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura are a team of apprentice ninjas from the ninja 
village of Konohagakure. On their first big mission, they (and their trainer 

Kakashi) found themselves bodyguarding the bridgebuilder Tazuna on his 
way back home to the Land of the Waves. But Tazuna hadn't revealed that 
he was the target of professional hitmen, hired by the evil millionaire Gat6 

to keep him from finishing his bridge! In a desperate fight, the four ninja 

were able to defeat the assassin Zabuza—but a mysterious masked ninja 
stole Zabuza’s body before the heroes realized he wasn’t dead. Now, assas- 


sins and bodyguards are both preparing for a rematch...

CHARACTER 
DESIGNS 


This was the original design for the character 
of Sasuke. It's hardly changed at all over time. 






























The main difference is the absence of the tal- 
isman he wore around his neck. In general, 
whenever | come up with a new character, 
my initial impulse is so use as much line and 
ornamentation as possible until the visual 
concept is in danger of becoming lost amid 
the busy, little details. 


This is especially true of principal characters. 
I get so caught up in what I’m doing with 
them, | make things much too difficult for 
myself; until | finally have the sense to step 
back and ask myself,““Am | really going to be 
able to draw such a fussy, complicated char- 
acter over and over, panel after panel, and 
issue after issue, week in and week out?” 


There was far too much going on visually with Sasuke, and too many lines 
overall, so | simplified him into a good, basic contrast to Naruto's visual 
image. 


Sasuke is a particular challenge for me to draw even now, because he is 
a young and rather pretty boy, but if I’m not careful he loses his youthful 
quality and | end up drawing him like a much older boy or a grown man. 
I've never had a character like him in one of my comics before—that kind 
of boy on the cusp of manhood, who’s somehow mature and handsome 
beyond his years. 


Keeping the visual consistently right makes him the character who takes 
the most work and energy from me. Maybe that’s why he’s become my 
favorite character.

HARUNO SAKURA EARLY 
CHARACTER 
DESIGNS 


This was how | first imagined 
Sakura. Let’s face it...she’s 
really not that cute, is she? 
Especially back then! But that 
was mostly because I’m not 
that good with female charac- 
ters in general, so making one 
of them cute is always a big 
challenge for me. 


When my editor, those around 
me, and even my own staff saw 
this design and read her per- 
sonality profile, they all 
assured me that Sakura was 
“far from cute”! Heh-heh... 





But | have my own reasons for being 
especially fond of Sakura, both in how 
she’s designed, and in her personality. | 
believe everyone possesses an “Inner 
Sakura” type voice in their heart, includ- 
ing things like her entirely arbitrary 
choice of love object. | think it gives her a 
real humanity that’s pretty sweet. 


There's a lot more to being a good female 
manga character than just cuteness, you 
know....At least, that’s my excuse. The 
troublemakers and the curmudgeons | 
can draw without breaking a sweat... but 
girls are really hard!

STORY GOES.
