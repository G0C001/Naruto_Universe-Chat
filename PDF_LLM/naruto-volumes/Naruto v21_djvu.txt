Story & Art by 


Masashi Kishimoto wotome 








There are so many movie trilogies 
and series these days, like THe 
Matrix, The Lord of the Rings, 
Harry Potter, etc. It gladdens 
me that my favorite film worlds 
continue to live on. 


—Masashi Kishitioto, 2004 





Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

STORY AND ART BY = 
MASASHI KISHIMOTO 











Twelve years ago a destructive nine-tailed fox spirit 
attacked the ninja village of Konohagakure. The Hokage, 
or village champion, defeated the fox by sealing its soul 
into the body of a baby boy. Now that boy, Uzumaki 
Naruto, has grown up to be a ninja-in-training, learning 
the art of ninjutsu with his teammates Sakura and Sasuke. 


Naruto and company take on the Chinin Selection 
Exams but suffer a sudden attack from Orochimaru in the 
Forest of Death. Orochimaru leaves a curse mark on 
Sasuke’s body and vanishes... 


...only to return to launch Operation Destroy Konoha! 
The attack appears to be thwarted when Lord Hokage 
sacrifices his own life. 


After the onslaught, Tsunade is elevated to the position 
of Fifth Hokage. She immediately attends to the medical 
needs of Sasuke and Rock Lee. Soon after Sasuke's 
recovery, however, the Sound Ninja Four set upon him. 
The Four attempt to woo Sasuke away with the power 
of Orochimaru, but...
