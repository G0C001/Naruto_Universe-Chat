—Masashi Kishitnoto, ZOOO 


Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (“Mechanism”). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in |997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

destructive fox spirit was

attention-seeking trouble- 
maker. His goal: to become 
the village's next Hokage. 


SASUKE A’ 


The top student in 
Naruto's class, Sasuke 
comes from the presti- 
gious Uchiha clan. His 
goal: to get revenge ona 
mysterious person who 
wronged him in the past.

THE STORY SO FAR... 


Twelve years ago, a destructive nine-tailed fox spirit attacked the ninja village of 
Konohagakure. The Hokage, or village champion, defeated the fox by sealing its soul 
into the body of a baby boy. Now that boy, Uzumaki Naruto, has grown up to become 
a ninja-in-training, learning the art of ninjutsu with his classmates Sakura and Sasuke. 


Tired of easy exercises, Naruto and his classmates make the mistake of asking their 


teacher, Kakashi, for a really hard assignment... and 


find themselves in the Land of 


Waves, protecting a bridge-builder named Tazuna. But the job turns truly dangerous 
when the notorious assassin Zabuza shows up. While Kakashi holds off Zabuza and 
Sakura protects Tazuna, Naruto and Sasuke face Zabuza’s assistant Haku. In the battle, 
Sasuke sacrifices himself to save Naruto from Haku’s deadly throwing needles. Now, 
watching his classmate fall, Naruto feels something terrible stir within him...

KISHIMOTO MASASHI’S FIRST MANGA REJECT SPECIAL! 


THE CHARACTER DESIGNS TO 
THE LEFT ARE FROM A FAILED 
PROJECT OF MINE CALLED 
"WANOERING DETOUR" THAT | 
CAME UP WITH RIGHT AFTER | 
WON THE HOP-STEP STAR 
AWARD. 


THE STORY IS ABOUT WHAT 
HAPPENS WHEN AN ELEMENTARY 
SCHOOL KID NAMED AKIRA ANDO 
HIS FRIENDS KATCHIN ANO KAORU 
FINO A WALLET ON THE WAY 
HOME FROM SCHOOL, AND OF 
ALL OF THE TROUBLE THAT 
ENSUES WHEN THE THREE OF 
THEM DECIDE TO KEEP THE 
MONEY THAT THEY FINO AND 
SPEND IT ON THEMSELVES. 
MAYBE IT WAS TOO HARD TO 
FOLLOW, OR SIMPLY TOO 
DOWN-TO-EARTH FORA BOYS’ 
ADVENTURE MAGAZINE... BUT 
FOR WHATEVER REASON, IT WAS 
SUMMARILY REJECTED. 


IT WAS MY FIRST REJECTION 
EVER. BUT | WAS SUCH AKID BACK 
THEN, EVEN GETTING MY FIRST 
REJECTION SEEMEDO LIKE A BIG 
DEAL, ANOTHER PROFESSIONAL 
MILESTONE 1I’0 PASSED. FOR THE 
LONGEST TIME, |'0 BEEN 
READING OTHER MANGA 
CARTOONISTS’ TALES OF WOE 
ABOUT THE REJECTIONS THEY’'D 
GOTTEN, AND I’0 BEEN FEELING 
ALITTLE LEFT OUT. WITH "WAN- 
DERING DETOUR," | WAS FINALLY 
IN THE CLUB! | EVEN BRAGGED 
ABOUT IT ALITTLE. LIKE | SAID, | 
WAS AKIO THEN. NOW, I’M A TRUE 
PROFESSIONAL, AND | AGREE 
WITH MY FRIENOS: “REJECTION 
SUCKS!” (LAUGHTER)

KISHIMOTO MASASHI’S 


POINTLESS LITTLE STORY 





THE EIGHT-FRAME MANGA ON THE 
LEFT BRINGS BACK FOND MEMORIES 
FOR ME OF KOISHI, THE FRIEND WHO 
DREW IT FOR ME BACK IN COLLEGE. 
| HAD BEEN DRAWING MANGA SINCE 
MY HIGH-SCHOOL DAYS, BUT | DIDN'T 
HAVE A SINGLE FRIEND WHO SHARED 
MY PASSION. IN COLLEGE, | HEARD OF 
A GROUP OF MANGA FANS AND ASPIRING 
ARTISTS WHO CALLED THEMSELVES 
THE MANKEN, OR MANGALAB. BUT 
THEY WEREN'T SO MUCH DRAWING MANGA 
AS THEY WERE PATTING EACH OTHER 
ON THE BACK FOR DRAWING PIN-UPS AND 
ILLUSTRATIONS WITH NO ATTEMPT AT 
STORYTELLING WHATSOEVER, | AVOIDED 
THOSE PHONIES LIKE THE PLAGUE AND 
WENT MY OWN WAY, TRYING TO DRAW 
ACTUAL MANGA. 
THEN, ONE DAY, | MET A MAN WHO 
CLAIMED HE HAD DRAWN AUTHENTIC 
MANGA BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL. | HAD 
DOUBTS ABOUT WHETHER HE WAS ON 
THE LEVEL, SO | CHALLENGEDHIM, | WAS 
DETERMINED TO FIND OUT WHETHER HE 
WAS A REAL MANGA ARTIST OR ANOTHER 
PHONY. | DEMANDED THAT HE DRAW A TWO- 
PAGE STORY FOR ME ON THE SPOT. SO HE 
DREW THE MANGA ON THE LEFT AND GAVE 
IT TO ME. IT WAS MOMENT OF INTENSE JOY 
FOR ME TO HOLD SOMEONE ELSE'S MANGA 
IN MY HAND LIKE THAT, FOR THE VERY FIRST 
TIME, AND | TREASURE HIS MANGA TO THIS 
VERY DAY.
