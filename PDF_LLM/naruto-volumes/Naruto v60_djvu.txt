For quite some time now, there 
have been occasions when | 
think of ideas while in the tub. 
It's because the blood flow to 
my head improves and makes it 
easier for ideas to spring forth. 
However, | cannot take notes in 
the tub... And after | get out of 
the tub, before | realize it, I've 
ended up forgetting what those 
ideas inside my head were. Both 
my mind and body have been 
washed clean. 





— Masashi Kishimoto, 2012 


Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

HE STORY SO FAR... ————_- 

Naruto, the biggest troublemaker at the Ninja Academy in the Village of 
Konohagakure, finally becomes a ninja along with his classmates Sasuke and 
Sakura. They grow and mature through countless trials and battles. However, 
Sasuke, unable to give up his quest for vengeance, leaves Konohagakure to 
seek Orochimaru and his power. 

Two years pass. Naruto grows up and engages in fierce battles against the 
Tailed Beast-targeting Akatsuki. Elsewhere, after winning the heroic battle 
against Itachi and learning his older brother's true intentions, Sasuke allies with 
the Akatsuki and sets out to destroy Konoha. 

The Fourth Great Ninja War against the Akatsuki begins. After a series of 
unfavorable battles early on, the Allied Shinobi Forces begin to rally and make 
a comeback. However, the war situation deteriorates once again thanks to 
Uchiha Madara, who has been summoned back to life by Kabuto, and the Five 
Shadows finally assemble upon the battlefield! Meanwhile, Naruto and Bee 
violently clash with six jinchuriki manipulated by the masked Madara!!
