BRUSH 
SCROLL 


— Masashi Kishimoto, 2012 


Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

THE STORY SO FAR... 


Naruto, the biggest troublemaker at the Ninja Academy in the Village of 
Konohagakure, finally becomes a ninja along with his classmates Sasuke and 
Sakura. They grow and mature through countless trials and battles. 
However, Sasuke, unable to give up his quest for vengeance, leaves 
Konohagakure to seek Orochimaru and his power... 

Two years pass. Naruto grows up and engages in fierce battles against the 
Tailed Beast-targeting Akatsuki. Elsewhere, after winning the heroic battle 
against Itachi and learning his older brother's true intentions, Sasuke allies 
with Akatsuki and sets out to destroy Konoha. 

The Fourth Great Ninja War against the Akatsuki begins. The Five 
Shadows seem powerless against the revived Madara’s power. Meanwhile, 
sasuke and Itachi confront Kabuto, who is dragging the battlefield into a 
vortex of chaos. Having surmounted their past differences, will the 
brothers’ united front finally succeed in stopping Kabuto?!
