Perhaps it seems abrupt, but it 
felt right to end part one with this 
volume. The next book will begin 
part two. In a sense, though, | 
don't think Naruto needs to be 
broken up into parts... Anyway, 
Stay with me, folks/ 


—_Masashi Kishitroto, 2005 





Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

Orochimaru 





Jiraiya 





Kakashi 


Twelve years ago a destructive nine-tailed fox spirit 
attacked the ninja village of Konohagakure. The Hokage, 
or village champion, defeated the fox by sealing its soul 
into the body of a baby boy. That boy is Naruto, once 
the bane of the Konohagakure Ninja Academy. Despite 
the rough start, he and his friends, Sasuke and Sakura, 
successfully join the ranks of the ninja. 


During the Chdnin Selection Exams, they are attacked 
by Orochimaru, who vanishes only after he places a 
curse mark on Sasuke. Halfway through the third exam, 
however, Orochimaru and his henchmen launch Opera- 
tion Destroy Konoha! The attack is thwarted when the 
Third Hokage sacrifices his life. After a deadly battle with 
Orochimaru, Tsunade becomes the Fifth Hokage. 


Lured by the power of Orochimaru, Sasuke departs 
Konoha in the company of the Sound Four. In pursuit of 
Sasuke, Shikamaru and his team weather desperate 
battles. Naruto clashes violently with Sasuke but he fails 
to stop his friend...

THE WORLD OF MASASHI KISHIMOTO 
PERSONAL HISTORY: SPECIAL FRIENDS, FART | 


MANGA ARTISTS HARDLY HAVE TIME TO GO OUT. THE REASON? EVERY 
WEEK, A NEW DEADLINE. IT'S A PRETTY DEMANDING LINE OF WORK. 


THUS | KEEP DECLINING INVITATIONS. CONSEQUENTLY, | KEEP SHEDDING 
FRIENDS. AT THIS POINT, MY ASSISTANTS ARE PRETTY MUCH ALL | HAVE 
LEFT. 


AS FOR MY WORK, | SPEND FOUR DAYS ALONE, CONJURING UP PLOTS (A 
PROCESS CALLED "NAME"). THIS PART IS DIFFERENT FROM THE DRAW- 
ING, IN THAT UNLESS | COME UP WITH AN IDEA, | CAN'T MOVE FORWARD. 
ONCE | DO FIND SOMETHING, | THEN SPEND THREE DAYS DRAWING IT. 
THING IS, SOMETIMES IT TAKES SIX DAYS TO SORT OUT A PLOT. WHEN 
THAT HAPPENS, I'VE GOT ONLY A DAY LEFT TO DRAW, SO | HAVE TO LEAN 
HEAVILY ON MY ASSISTANTS TO MAKE THE DEADLINE. 


EVEN THEN | STILL HAVE TO GENERATE A WHOLE ROUGH DRAFT MYSELF, 
WHICH DOESN'T HELP MUCH. THE KEY TO SPEEDING THINGS ALONG ISIN 
FINALIZING THE ORAFT WITH PEN. THE SIMPLER CHARACTERS THAT USE 
FEWER LINES MY ASSISTANTS CAN CLEAN UP FOR ME. THAT SAID, | 
HAVEONLY ONE ASSISTANT WHO CAN IMITATE MY STYLE OF DRAWING, SO 
THE TWO OF US HAVE TO HANOLE MOST OF THE "BIG" WORK. 


WHERE WE REALLY RUN INTO TROUBLE, ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE BEHIND 
SCHEDULE, IS WHEN NARUTO CONJURES UP A MASS OF SHADOW DOP- 
PELGANGERS. FOR INSTANCE, TAKE A PEEK AT VOL. 23, FAGES 64-65. 
NARUTO IS PLASTERED EVERYWHERE, ALL OVER A TWO-FAGE SPREAD, 
THE TWO OF US DIVIDED THE WORK AND DREW LIKE MAQMEN. WE WERE 
CUTTING SO CLOSE TO THE DEADLINE, WE HAD TO PULL ALL-NIGHTERS. 
THE MOMENT WE FINISHED THESE TWO FAGES, MY ASSISTANT COL- 
LAPSED AND FELL ASLEEP. THE THING IS, THOUGH, WE STILL HAD OTHER 
FAGES TO COMPLETE, SO HE COULD ONLY TAKE A QUICK NAP! AT TIMES 
LIKE THIS, | MENTALLY APOLOGIZE FOR HIS SUFFERING, AND HOPING TO 
SOFTEN THE TENSION, | SEARCH FOR SOMETHING TO LIVEN THE WORK- 
PLACE... FOR INSTANCE, SHOCK THERAPY. SO THAT DAY, WHILE HE WAS 
NAPPING, | PHOTOCOPIED THE TWO-FAGE SPREAD AND SPLATTERED INK 
ALL OVER IT, AS IF BY ACCIDENT...

YOu 
ARE NOW 
OFFICIALLY MY

WHEN | WAS 
RESEARCHING

ART OF 
IMMORTALITY... 





/ MY SOURCES 


| ff BROUGHT TO 


MY ATTENTION 

A SOME RELIABLE 
Al INFORMATION 

/ REGARDING THE 

/f AKATSUKI. 








I'VE COME 
HERE TO 
MAKE A 
FORMAL 

ANNOUNCE- 


















THEY 
WON'T BE 
BACK FOR 
YOU... 








FOR 
THREE OR 
FOUR MORE 










IT’S SO 
FAR AWAY. 










HAVE TIME 
FOR PLAYING 
AROUND WITH 
YOU IN THE 
MEANTIME! 


SHAS 





OROCHIMARU 
COULD 
KILL HIM!! 


IT SOUNDS 
LIKE YOU KNOW 
THE REAL 
REASON 
OROCHIMARU 
WANTS SASUKE. 








BUT IT 
APPEARS WE 
HAVE MORE 
THAN THREE 
YEARS BEFORE 
HE CAN USE 
SASUKE'S 
BODY AS HIS 
VESSEL. 


THE DEAL |S, 
THE ART OF 
IMMORTALITY 
DEMANDS A 
BUFFER OF 
AT LEAST 


..BEFORE 
HE CAN 
RE-TRANSFER 
HIS SOUL. 


DION'T 
AND, WELL, | JUST 
| CAN'T TELL 
GUARANTEE YOU? 
YOU [00 
PERCENT... 


I'VE 
BEEN 
RESEARCHING 
OROCHIMARU'S 
ART OF 
IMMORTALITY... 


ALREADY 
TRANSFERRED 
HIMSELF TO 
ANEW BODY... 


SO THAT 
GIVES US 
THREE YEARS 
BEFORE HE 
TAKES SASUKE. 





« 


READ 
THIS 
WAY 


« 





HE 
WILL NOT 
CHANGE. 





ANO 
SASUKE |S 
OF THE SAME 
CLOTH AS 
OROCHIMARU. 












SASUKE 
WENT TO 
OROCHIMARU 
WILLINGLY... 


| 
KNOW THIS. 
I'VE SEEN 
SHINOBI 
COME ANDO 
GO. 





IT IS THE 
TRAGIC FATH OF 
SELF-RIGHTEOUS 





FORGET 
BRINGING 
HIM BACK. 





SAS 


LOOK AT 
WHAT HE’S 
DONE TO 
YOU! 


HE MAY BE 
NOTHING TO YOU, 


PERVY SAGE 


YOU CALL 
HIM A 
FRIEND?! 








WE'RE THE 
THREE GREAT 
SHINOBI... 
WE'VE BEEN 
FRIENOS 
SINCE WE @w 
WERE KIDS! 


THAT'S 
WHAT MAKES 
IT SO EASY TO 

PULL THE 
WOOL OVER 
YOUR EYES. 








WHY... 





YOU 
NEVER 
DO THINK 
THINGS 
THROUGH... 






OH, 
JIRAIYA. 
YOUR - 
NAIVETE 
WOULD BE 
TOUCHING, 
WERE IT 
NOT SO 
STUPID. 

















SO, 
OROCHIMARU. 
| TAKE IT 
YOU WON'T 
CHANGE YOUR 
MIND, THEN? 





y THERE WAS NO 
COMING BACK 
FOR HIM. 


FORALL MY 
STRUGGLE, 
» ALL | WAS LEFT 
WITH WAS THIS 


SENSE OF 
POWER- 
LESSNESS... y 


ANO REGRET... 


IF YOU'RE 
INTENT ON 
CHASING SASUKE, 
THEN FORGET 
THE TRAINING. 


I'LL STICK THE 
ANBU BLACK 
OPS ON YOU, 

AND YOU'LL BE 

FORBIDDEN

YOU'RE NO

MY WORDS... 


IF YOU'RE 
DETERMINED 
TO DO WHAT 
YOU PLEASE, 
| HAVE NO 
CHOICE. 


YOu 
MUST 


FORGET SOMEDAY 


SASUKE. YOU WILL FACE

GREATER THAN 
OROCHIMARU. 





SAS 


DON'T | 
BLAME | HE WAS

SOONER OR

IF YOU 
WANT TO 
LIVE AS 
SHINOBI, 
YOU MUST 


BE SMARTER. / _~ 


IT’S NO 
PLACE FOR 
AFOOL. 
THAT'S THE 
REALITY. 





TO BE 
SHINOBGI, 
YOU NEED 
MORE THAN

BE READY,

ONE. 


YOU TRY 
THIS ON 
YOUR OWN... 











BUT YOU

WITH THAT 
KINO OF 
BREEDING, 
SHOULDN'T 
YOU BE GREAT 
ALREADY? 





THE UCHIHA 
CLAN IS MADE 

UP OF ELITES... 
RIGHT ? 





READ 
THIS 
WAY 





IF WE'RE 
ALL DONE, 
DO YOU 
MINO IF | 
EXPLAIN THE 
MISSION 








ACCORDING 
TO MY INFO, 
THEY'VE ALREADY 
DEPLOYED A 
THOUSAND 
SHINOBI TO THE 
BATTLEFRONT. 


FOR THEM 
TO BE ABLE 
TO STORM IN 

LIKE THIS... 


THEY MUST 
HAVE AN 
EFFICIENT 
SYSTEM FOR 
REINFORCEMENT. 


THEREFORE 
SHINOBI LIKE US, 
WHOSE FOCUS 
IS SABOTAGE... 


DEPLOY IN 
A SHORT, 
TAUT UNIT. 


.. THE LAND 
OF EARTH IS 
CURRENTLY 
INVADING 
KUSAGAKURE. 


KUSAGAKURE 
IS SITUATED 
RIGHT NEXT 
TO THE LAND [v7 
OF FIRE. 


WE 
SHOULD 
HAVE 
STEPPED 
IN LONG 
AGO. 


TO CRUSH 
ONE'S ENEMY 
AT THE 
BATTLEFRONT 
REQUIRES 
AN IMMENSE 
FORCE OF 
SHINOBI. 





THEY'VE 
ADVANCED 


=" EVEN FURTHER 


HERE. MISSION 
ee 
















DESTROY THE 





AND SUPPLY BRIDGE, 
PROMPTLY BREAK UP THE 
. EVACUATE. SUPPORT 
* OPERATION... 



















IT'S THE 
BRIDGE? 


YOU'RE 
SAYING 
THISIS AN 
INFILTRATION 
MISSION. 












THAT 
SHOULD 
DISTRACT 
THEM, 

IF NOTHING 











WE'LL STICK 
TOGETHER UNTIL 
THE BORDER. 
FROM THERE, 
WE SPLIT UP 
AND SET ABOUT 
OUR OWN 
MISSIONS.
