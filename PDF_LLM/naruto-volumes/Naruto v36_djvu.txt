—Masashi Kishitioto, Z2OO6 





Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

Naruto, the biggest troublemaker at the Ninja Academy in 
Konohagakure, finally becomes a ninja along with his classmates 
Sasuke and Sakura. During the Chinin Selection Exams, Orochi- 
maru and his henchmen launch Operation Destroy Konoha. 
Naruto’s mentor, the Third Hokage, sacrifices his own life to stop 
the attack, and Tsunade becomes Fifth Hokage. Lured by 
Orochimaru’s promise of power, Sasuke leaves Konohagakure 
after defeating Naruto, who fights valiantly to stop his friend... 





| 
















Two years pass and Naruto and his comrades grow up and track 
down Sasuke. However, they are left in the dust by Sasuke’s im- 
mense power, and he escapes once more. 





Meanwhile, Hidan and Kakuzu—members of the Akatsuki— 
seek to fulfill their organization's goal to possess all the jinchdriki 
hosts by confronting and capturing Yugito, the Two-Tailed Cat 
Demon. Though their plans for these immensely powerful beasts 
remain a mystery, it’s a threat Konoha can ill afford to take lightly, 
especially after this deadly duo lays siege to a monastery in the 
Land of Fire and slaughters all the monks. Among them, Lord 
Chiriku—formerly of the Guardian Shinobi Twelve—whose body 
it now falls to Captain Asuma and Cell 10 to locate and retrieve...
