My favorite video games are 
from the old floppy disc system 
software that was sold such a 
long time ago. Now, those 
games are being re-released as 
retro games for the Game Boy. 
They're so ridiculous that 
they're irresistible! 





—_Masashi Kishitmoto, 2004 


Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

> (SE. a ; 






















Naruto, the biggest troublemaker at the 
Ninja Academy in the Village of Konohagakure, 
finally became a ninja along with his class- 
mates Sasuke and Sakura. During the Chunin 
Exams, Orochimaru launched a surprise 
attack, Operation Destroy Konoha, during 
which the Third Hokage sacrificed his own life 
to save the village. 


a | 





Tsunade becomes the Fifth Hokage as a con- 
fused Sasuke leaves Konohagakure with the 
Sound Ninja Four. Shikamaru and his team 
pursue Sasuke and end up facing-off against 
the Sound Four, only to be saved by Gaara. 
Now, Naruto has finally caught up to the 
renegade Sasuke...
