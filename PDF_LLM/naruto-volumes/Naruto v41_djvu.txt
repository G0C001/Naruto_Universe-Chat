ored that a Japanese manga was

—Masashi Kishimoto, 2008 





Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

SSS, 


THE STORY SO FAR... 


Once the bane of the Konohagakure Ninja Academy, Uzumaki Naruto now 
serves dutifully among the ranks of the Konoha shinobi—an illustrious group of 
ninja sworn to protect their village from the forces of evil seeking to destroy it 
from without and within... 

After his former classmate, Uchiha Sasuke, is seduced by the evil Orochimaru, 
Naruto makes it his personal mission to find and save his friend from the dark- 
ness growing inside him. Sasuke, however, doesn’t want to be found. He only 
seeks revenge on the man he hates most in the world—the one he blames for 
murdering his parents—his older brother, Uchiha Itachi. Though Sasuke’s quest is 
temporarily delayed after he comes into conflict with his brother's associates in 
the insidious organization known as the Akatsuki, at long last he catches up to 
Itachi... 

Meanwhile, Jiraiya infiltrates the Hidden Rain Village on a top-secret mission to 
gather intelligence on Pain, the Akatsuki’s enigmatic leader. Little does he realize 
he, too, is being watched...
