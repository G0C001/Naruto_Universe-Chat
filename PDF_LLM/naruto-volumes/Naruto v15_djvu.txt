Hmm. Some movies I've seen

—Masashi Kishitnoto, 2002 


Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

NARVTO’S NINJA HANDBOOK! 


STORY AND ART BY 
MASASHI] KISHIMOTO 


b 


BDDOOGGOOO— 











Twelve years ago a destructive nine-tailed fox spirit 
attacked the ninja village of Konohagakure. The 
Hokage, or village champion, defeated the fox by 
sealing its soul into the body of a baby boy. Now that 
boy, Uzumaki Naruto, has grown up to be a ninja-in- 
training, learning the art of ninjutsu with his team- 
mates Sakura and Sasuke. 


Naruto and company take on the Chinin Selection 
Exams but suffer a sudden attack from Orochimaru 
in the Forest of Death. Orochimaru leaves a curse 
mark on Sasuke’s body and vanishes... 


Then, during the finals of the Chdnin Exams, Oro- 
chimaru, disguised as Kazekage, takes the Hokage 
hostage and erects a barrier shield. Operation 
Destroy Konoha is under way as Naruto chases after 
Sasuke and Gaara, who have both disappeared.

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, FART 21 


IN MY SECOND YEAR OF COLLEGE, AFTER | GOT TO KNOW MY 
TWO MANGA-DRAWING UPPERCLASSMEN, | SELECTED THE 
TRADE PUBLICATIONS | WANTED TO WORK FOR, AND STARTED TO 
DRAW MANGA AIMED TOWARD THOSE MAGAZINES’ CONTESTS. 


EVEN AMONG THE NEWCOMER MANGA AWARDS, THERE’S A LOT 
OF VARIATION. 


EACH MAGAZINE HAS A DIFFERENT STYLE OR THEME, AND IF 
YOU DON'T MATCH YOUR WORK TO THOSE THEMES, IT’S MORE 
OIFFICULT TO GET SELECTED. 


FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU DREW AND SUBMITTED A HOT-BLOODED 
BATTLE ACTION MANGA WITH ONLY STRAPPING MALE CHARAC- 
TERS TO A SHOJO MANGA MAGAZINE CONTEST, THE MOMENT 
THEY OPENED YOUR ENVELOPE AND SAW YOUR COVER ILLUS- 
TRATION, THEY WOULO PUT IT BACK IN THE ENVELOPE, SEAL IT, 
ANO EITHER THROW IT IN THE TRASH OR SEND IT BACK TO YOU. 
WELL, THAT MIGHT BE A RATHER EXTREME EXAMPLE, BUT 
UNLESS YOU REALLY TRY TO UNDERSTAND A MAGAZINE'S 
FLAVOR, YOU'LL JUST BE LABELED A “POOR MISGUIDED FOOL.” 


WHERE IT ESPECIALLY GETS TRICKY IS THE DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN SEINEN AND SHONEN MAGAZINES. BECAUSE THEY 
ARE SOMEWHAT SIMILAR IN TASTES, IT’S VERY EASY TO GET 
THEM CONFUSED. | WAS A CASE IN POINT MYSELF. | OFTEN 
OREW HALF-ANO-HALF MANGA THAT COULD HAVE QUALIFIED AS 
EITHER SEINEN OR SHONEN. THE REASON IS THAT THE MANGA 
THAT HAD INFLUENCED ME WERE THE SHONEN TITLE DRAGON- 
BALL AND THE SEINEN TITLE AKIRA, THUS, | ACTUALLY WENT 
THROUGH A PERIOD WHERE | DEBATED WHICH FLOW | SHOULD 
GO WITH, ANO EVEN IF | CHOSE ONE, ELEMENTS OF THE OTHER 
WOULD CREEP IN. BESIDES, BEYOND ANY SUPERFICIAL SIMILARI- 
TIES, THE ART DESIGN, DIALOGUE, TENSION, THEME, AND REP- 
RESENTATION ARE QUITE DIFFERENT, SO (IN MY CASE!) | HAD TO 
DECIDE WHICH TYPE | WAS GOING TO DRAW AND GO WITH JUST 
ONE. 


THUS, | MADE MY CHOICE, WHICH AT THAT TIME WAS TO AIM FOR 
SEINEN MAGAZINES. AT THE TIME, THE AKIRA INFLUENCE WAS 
GREATER IN MY ART STYLE AND NAME (OUTLINE/STORYBOARDS), 
ANDO | THOUGHT THAT MY PERSONALITY WAS MORE SUITED. 
TOWARD SEINEN MAGAZINES AS WELL. HOWEVER, WHEN | TRIED 
TO DRAW SEINEN-AIMED MANGA, | JUST COULDN'T GET RID OF 
THE FEELING THAT SOMETHING WASN'T RIGHT, AND IT DION’T GO 
WELL... | REALIZED | HAD TO CONTEMPLATE WHAT | WANTED TO 
ORAW A LOT DEEPER, ANDO THE MORE | ANALYZED IT, THE 
“THING” THAT HAD PERMEATED THE DEPTHS OF MY HEART KEPT 
RISING TO THE SURFACE. IT WAS THAT INVINCIBLE MASTERPIECE 
OF SHONEN MANGA... DRAGONBALL... (AND YOU KNOW FROM 
NARUTO WHAT’S HAPPENED SINCE ©).

MY PERSONAL HISTORY, PART 22 


SO AFTERALL THAT, HAVING DECIDED | WOULD AIM FOR 
SHONEN MAGAZINES, | IMMEDIATELY CHOSE WITHOUT ANY 
HESITATION THE SPECIFIC SHONEN MAGAZINE WHOSE 
CONTEST | WOULD ENTER. OF COURSE, | CHOSE WEEKLY 
SHONEN JUMP, THE MAGAZINE IN WHICH DRAGON BALL AP- 
PEARED. 


HOWEVER, | SUDDENLY RAN RIGHT INTO A WALL... 


BECAUSE | HAD INITIALLY BEEN AIMING FOR SEINEN MAGA- 
ZINES, MY ART STYLE WAS NO LONGER SHONEN. WELL, TO A 
CERTAIN EXTENT, | COULD STILL DRAW SHONEN-LIKE STYLE, 
BUT | JUST COULDN'T GET CRAZY ABOUT MY CHARACTER 
DESIGNS. | HAD BEEN GROPING ABOUT FOR AN ORIGINAL ART 
STYLE THIS WHOLE TIME, BUT THERE WAS ONE OTHER THING 
THAT WASN'T GOING WELL AT ALL FOR ME. | COULO ORAW 
PLENTY OF ROUGH SKETCHES OR STORYBOARDS, BUT THEN | 
COULON’T FIGURE OUT HOW TO EXPRESS THEM WELL WITH 
LINES; IN SHORT, HOW ONE DISTORTS AND EXPRESSES LINES 
REFLECTS THAT INDIVIOUAL’S SENSE. 


AT THE TIME, | HAD BEEN SEARCHING HIGH ANO LOW WITHOUT 
SUCCESS FOR NEW DRAWINGS THAT HAD GOOD SENSE IN AD- 
DITION TO BEING GREAT ART, BUT THERE HAD BEEN NOTHING 

SINCE AKIRA THAT HAD CAUGHT My EYE. 


ANO THEN ONE DAY,| SAW AN ANIME THAT TOTALLY BLEW ME 
AWAY... BECAUSE IT CONTAINED ALL OF THE ELEMENTS | HAD 
BEEN SEEKING. THAT ANIME WAS HASHIRE MEROSU (RUN, 
MELOS).

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, PART 22 (CONTINUED) 


HASHIRE MEROSU (RUN, MELOS) REALLY AMAZED ME! THE 
MUSCLES AND BONE STRUCTURE WERE REPRESENTED WITH 
NEW LINE TECHNIQUES, AND THE DESIGNS FELT REALLY 
FRESH. NOT TO MENTION REALLY COOL. | IMMEDIATELY 
BECAME INTERESTED IN THE CHARACTER DESIGNER AND 
ANIMATION DIRECTOR OKIURA HIROYUKI, AND AS | RE- 
SEARCHED HIS FILMOGRAPHY AT THE LOCAL VIDEO RENTAL 
STORE, | STARTEO NOTICING THAT SOME OF THE ANIMATORS’ 
NAMES APPEARED AGAIN AND AGAIN IN MANY OTHER FILMS. 
“OH! THIS GUY, HE WORKED ON THIS FILM TOO. OH! THIS GUY 
TOO” .. ALONG THE WAY, | GOT INTO ALL SORTS OF ANIME, 
AND STARTED MEMORIZING THE NAMES OF VARIOUS ANIMA- 
TION DIRECTORS ANO ANIMATORS. AT THAT TIME, WHEN 
MANGA WERE MADE INTO ANIMATION, THE ANIME OFTEN HAD 
BETTER ART, SO | HAD STARTED FEELING THAT ANIMATORS 
WERE BETTER ARTISTS. AND THAT IS WHEN MY ENCOUNTER 
WITH A CERTAIN TITLE AND A CERTAIN ANIMATOR IMMENSELY 
INFLUENCED ME. 


THAT TITLE WAS JUMP’S FAMOUS MINKE, A NINJA MANGA JUST 
LIKE MINE. ANO THE ANIMATOR WHO INFLUENCED ME WAS 
NISHIO TETSUYA, THE CHARACTER DESIGNER AND ANIMATION 
DIRECTOR FOR THE ANIMATED VERSION.

JUST... 
Just 
AGAINST 
THIS GUY... 











THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, PART 22 (PART 3) 


REGULARLY MIMICKING THE ART STYLES OF MY FAVORITE ANI- 
MATORS AT THE TIME, SUCH AS OKIURA-SAN AND MORIMOTO 
KOUJI-SAN, STARTED SHIFTING MY STYLE TOWARD SEINEN 
MAGAZINES AND AWAY FROM SHONEN MAGAZINES AGAIN. 

.«. THAT'S WHEN | FORTUITOUSLY SAW IN MY TARGET MAGAZINE 
THAT THE SERIES THAT | LIKED EVEN AS A MANGA, INKL, HAD 
BECOME ANIMATED, SO | DECIDED | WOULD WATCH IT WHILE 
EATING A SALMON BENTO AND PREPARED MY MEAL AND SAT 
MYSELF DOWN IN FRONT OF THE TELEVISION. THE MOMENT | 
STUCK THE DISPOSABLE CHOPSTICKS IN MY MOUTH TO SPLIT 
THEM APART, THE VINK ANIME STARTED, AND | GOT DRAWN 
RIGHT INTO THE OPENING SEQUENCE WITH THE STILL UNBRO- 
KEN CHOPSTICKS FORGOTTEN IN MY MOUTH. 


IT MADE SUCH AN IMPACT ON ME! FOR IT CONTAINED NEW DIS- 
TORTIONS, HAD GREAT SENSE, EVEN BETTER ART, AND ON TOP 
OF IT ALL, JUST INDESCRIBABLE, REALLY REFRESHING LINE 
TECHNIQUE THAT SEEMED LIKE A MIX OF SEINEN AND SHONEN 
STYLES. IN SHORT, IT WAS THE IDEAL ART STYLE THAT | HAD 
BEEN SEEKING. 


“THIS 1S IT!” | THOUGHT TO MYSELF. 


SINCE THEN, | STARTED MIMICKING NISHIO-SAN’S DRAWINGS, 
AND IT PRETTY MUCH WAS THE BASIS FOR THE ART STYLE OF 
THIS CURRENT WARUTO. AND AS SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW, 
AMONG ONE OF THE CHARACTER DESIGNERS FOR THE 
NARUTO ANIME |S NISHIO TETSUYA-SAN HIMSELF. | AM A LUCKY 
MAN. THE MAN THAT | RESPECTED ANO RECEIVED SO MUCH IN- 
FLUENCE FROM |S DOING DESIGNS FOR ME! IT WASA REALLY 
HAPPY MOMENT FOR ME WHEN | HEARD THIS, LIKE ONE OF MY 
OREAMS HAD COME TRUE (AND IN THAT INSTANT, | INVOLUNTARI- 
LY PUMPED MY FISTS IN THE AIR.) PLUS, ANOTHER ONE OF THE 
CHARACTER DESIGNERS |S SUZUKI HIROFUMI-SAN. HE IS AN 
AWESOME FELLOW WHO HAS WORKED ON SOME OF MY FAVOR- 
ITE ANIME. THEY ARE SUCH GREAT ARTISTS THAT I’M EMBAR- 
RASSED THAT THEY LOOK AT MY MANGA. 











YOU CAN'T 
EVEN COME

HUNTED ME
