My cover image for this volume 
was inspired by the Nine-Tailed 
Fox Naruto that appears in the 
GameCube game, Clash of Nina. 
They did such an awesome job with 
the presentation that | couldn't 
resist imitating it. 





—Masashi Kishitroto, 2005 


Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

ecnoeegge ‘ae 








Twelve years ago a destructive nine-tailed fox spirit attacked 


the ninja village of Konohagakure. The Hokage, or village 
champion, defeated the fox by sealing its soul into the body 
of a baby boy. That boy is Naruto, once the bane of the 
Konohagakure Ninja Academy. 


Despite the rough start, he and his friends, Sasuke and Sakura, 
successfully join the ranks of the ninja. During the Chdnin Ninja 
Selection Exam, they are attacked by Orochimaru, who vanishes 
only after he places a curse mark on Sasuke. Halfway through 
the third exam, however, Orochimaru and his henchmen launch 
Operation Destroy Konoha. The attack is thwarted when the 
Third Hokage sacrifices his life. After the deadly battle, 
Tsunade steps up to become the Fifth Hokage. 


Charmed by the power of Orochimaru, Sasuke departs 
Konoha in the company of the Sound Ninja. In pursuit of Sasuke, 
Shikamaru and his team weather desperate battles. As Naruto 
finally closes in on his friend, Sasuke's mind is struck by vivid 
memories of his brother, Itachi.
