Lately, all over the world, there has 
3} been an upswing in terrorist acts— 
7) attacks by armed groups and the tak- 
ing of hostages—by the worst kind of 
4 criminals. In an effort to resolve these 
a situations with as little bloodshed and 
i fanfare as possible, nations all over 
the globe are increasingly turning 

—— E toward special operations forces, 
eA RB armed with the latest technologies and 
finely honed skills, giving them superla- 
tive intelligence-gathering capabilities. Such operatives are 
truly the modern analog to the type of warriors who, in the 
past, were known as ninja! 

—_Masashi Kishitroto, 2000 





Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (“Mechanism”). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

stantly distracted by her 
crush on Sasuke. Her goal: 
to win Sasuke’s heart! 


NARUTO JU b 


When Naruto was born, a 
destructive fox spirit was 
imprisoned inside his body. 
Spurned by the older vil- 
lagers, he’s grown into an 
attention-seeking trouble- 
maker. His goal: to become 
the village’s next Hokage. 





SASUKE }A/7r 


The top student in 
Naruto’s class, Sasuke 
comes from the presti- 
gious Uchiha clan. His 
goal: to get revenge on a

takes place in the Forest of Death! She's 
determined to cut down the number of teams

Gai, is one of the most talented young shinobi steal their second scroll from the weakest 
around, and he’s completely infatuated with Sakura. team in the bunch—Naruto’s! 


THE STORY SO FARR... 
Twelve years ago, a destructive nine-tailed fox spirit attacked the ninja village of 
Konohagakure. The Hokage, or village champion, defeated the fox by sealing its soul 


into the body of a baby boy. Now that boy, Uzumaki Naruto, has grown up to become 
a ninja-in-training, learning the art of ninjutsu with his classmates Sakura and Sasuke. 


Astonishingly, Naruto and his team passed the written section of the Chdnin 
(Journeyman Ninja) Selection Exam, but they face new dangers in the exam’s second 
portion, which is conducted in the Forest of Death! The object of the exercise is to 

reach the tower in the center of the forest with two scrolls in hand, and all three team 
members alive, before five days elapse. Each of the 26 teams is given only one scroll, 
and must steal the second scroll from another team using any means necessary!
