Recently, the batteries in my TV 

and DVD player remote control 

have started running out of juice, 
responding sluggishly when | press the 
buttons and not powering on easily. 
However, they do still eventually turn 
on, so | keep telling myself “Eh, it's 
Still okay...” and procrastinating. 
And then | noticed something. Once 
the remote stops working at all, if | 
open up its battery case and rub the 
batteries, it starts working again! You 
all should try it too! 


It's true... though it would be faster just to change the batteries. 





—Masashi Kishitnoto, 2070 


Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

THE STORY SO FAR... 


Naruto, the biggest troublemaker at the Ninja Academy in the Village of 
Konohagakure, finally becomes a ninja. Along with his classmates Sasuke 
and Sakura, he grows and matures during countless trials and battles. 
Sasuke, unable to give up his quest for vengeance, leaves Konohagakure 
to seek the renegade ninja Orochimaru, from whom he hopes to gain 
immense power. 

Two years pass. Naruto battles against the Tailed Beast-targeting 
Akatsuki. Elsewhere, after winning the epic battle against his brother Itachi, 
Sasuke learns the truth about Itachi’s perceived betrayal of their clan. He 
allies with the Akatsuki and sets out to destroy Konoha. 

Ultimately, Naruto saves his village. But Danzo of the Black Ops is 
appointed the Sixth Hokage in Tsunade’s place. And the Raikage—leader 
of the Cloud Village—summons a meeting of the five other leaders. 
Sasuke attacks, and engages in battle with the Raikage!!
