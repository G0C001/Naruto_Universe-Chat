—Masashi Kishitnoto, 2007 


Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in |997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

VOL. 8 
LIFE-AND-DEATH BATTLES 


STORY AND ART BY 
MASASHI KISHIMOTO 





SAKURA 7} 77 


Smart and studious, Sakura 
is the brightest of Naruto’s 
classmates, but she’s 
constantly distracted by her 
crush on Sasuke. Her goal: 
to win Sasuke’s heart! 


NARUTO FV b 


When Naruto was born, a 
destructive fox spirit was 
imprisoned inside his body. 
Spurned by the older 
villagers, he’s grown into an 
attention-seeking trouble- 
maker. His goal: to become 
the village’s next Hokage. 


SASUKE th A77 


The top student in 
Naruto’s class, Sasuke 
comes from the presti- 
gious Uchiha clan. His 
goal: to get revenge on a 
mysterious person who 
wronged him in the past. 








The Third Hokage ={t fH k2% 


The head ninja and leader of the village 





Iruka 47-4) of Konohagakure. 
Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura’s teacher — ia : 
from their Ninja Academy days. lruka 4ae 


has a soft spot in his heart for Naruto 
because he also grew up as an orphan. 









Yakushi Kabuto 
Sih 7b 

Kabuto helped Naruto's 
team finish the second 
stage of the exam, but 
they have no idea that 
he’s one of Orochimaru’s 
Sound Ninja spies! 





Orochimaru Kieu 


This nefarious master of disguise attacked 
Sasuke and left a powerful curse-mark on 
his neck. He hopes to mold Sasuke into his 
successor...assuming he survives the effects 
of the curse! 


THE STORY SO FARR... 
Twelve years ago, a destructive nine-tailed fox spirit attacked the ninja village of Konohagakure. The 
Hokage, or village champion, defeated the fox by sealing its soul into the body of a baby boy. Now that 


boy, Uzumaki Naruto, has grown up to become a ninja-in-training, learning the art of ninjutsu with his 
classmates Sakura and Sasuke. 


After a long and harrowing journey through the Forest of Death, Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura 
finally secure the scrolls they need to pass the second stage of the Chdnin (Journeyman Ninja) 
Selection Exam. With Heaven and Earth scrolls in hand, they head to the tower in the center of 

the Forest of Death that marks the exams finish line. Inside the tower, Naruto, Sasuke and 
Sakura are greeted by a cryptic message from The Third Hokage. They understand enough of the 
message to realize they should open both of their scrolls at the same time, so they prepare to 
unfurl them, unsure of what they'll find inside. ..

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, FART 5 


WHEN | GOT TO THE FINAL YEARS OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, 

| GOT HOOKED ON SHONEN JUMP MANGA, THANKS TO THE 
ANIMATED DRAGON BALL SERIES. BUT EVEN BEFORE 
ORAGON BALL, | LOVED THE ANIME VERSION OF A JUMP 
COMIC CALLED KINNIKLMAN (ULTIMATE MUSCLE) ON TV. 

MY BROTHER AND | BOTH BECAME IDIOTICALLY OBSESSED 
WITHIT, AND THE TWO OF US PLAYED AROUND ALOT, DESIGN- 
ING OUR OWN SUPERHEROES. 


MY LITTLE BROTHER'S FAVORITE CREATION WAS HIS KABUTO- 
MUSHI (RHINOCEROS BEETLE) SUPERHERO KNOWN AS 
“BEETLE MAN,” AND SINCE | WAS A FANATIC FOR SPICES AND 
CONDIMENTS, MY SPECIALTIES WERE ‘WASABI MAN” AND 
“KARASHI MUSTARD MAN” (PROBABLY DUE TO THE INFLUENCE 
OF AHERO CHARACTER IN KINMIKLIMAN NAMED “CURRY COOK”)... 
AFTER DISCOVERING WHAT GREAT SUPERHEROES | COULD 
MAKE OUT OF FOODSTUFFS, | ONLY HAD TO OPEN THE 
REFRIGERATOR TO FIND ALL KINDS OF HOT NEW IDEAS FOR 
ORIGINAL CHARACTERS. AND | REALLY THOUGHT THE VARIOUS 
SPICE NAMES HAD A NICERING TO THEM. BIZARRE, | KNOW... 
BUT | TOOK IT VERY SERIOUSLY BACK THEN. 


AROUND THE SAME TIME, | GOT MY FIRST LOOK AT THE 
ANIMATED FIST OF THE NORTH STAR, AND | GOT TOTALLY INTO 

IT. AT SCHOOL, WHEN MY GROUP GOT ASSIGNED TO CLEAN THE 
CLASSROOM, IT WAS SO DIFFICULT TO CARRY THE HEAVY STEEL 
TRASH CAN OUT TO THE INCINERATOR ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE 
SCHOOLYARD THAT | DEVELOPED A TACTIC TO EVADE THE TASK. 
"'0 POKE MY FRIENO’'S TEMPLES WITH MY THUMBS AND SAy, “I 
HAVE JUST PRESSED ONE OF YOUR SECRET MERIDIAN POINTS. 
YOU WILL NOW TAKE THE TRASH CAN TO THE INCINERATOR 

TO EMPTY IT.” MY FRIENDS WOULD RETALIATE BY RETORTING, 

“| HAVE PRESSED THE SAME SECRET POINT" IN VERY SERIOUS 
TONES, AND WE'D SPEND QUITE A WHILE PRESSING EACH 
OTHER'S SECRET POINTS -- INA COMPLETELY FRIENDLY WAY -- 
WHILE GETTING MASSIVE EXPOSURE TO THINGS LIKE DIOXINS 
THAT THE WORLD HAD NEVER HEARD OF BACK THEN.

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, FART 6 


DURING MY LAST FEW YEARS OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, | WAS 
COMPLETELY ADDICTED TO DRAGON BALL. | HAD NEVER BEEN 
SO INTO ANYTHING BEFORE, AND | REVERED TORIYAMA AKIRA 
LIKE A GOD, AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY THAT AROSE, | WOULD 
TRACE AND DRAW ALL OF THE CHARACTERS FROM DRAGON 
BALL AND PORE OVER MY FRIENDS’ COPIES OF SHONEN JUMF- 
ALL SO | COULD SEE MORE DRAGON BALL.| WASN'T GETTING A 
SINGLE YEN IN ALLOWANCE AT THAT TIME -- THE ONLY MONEY | 
HAD WAS THE GIFTS OF CASH |'0 GET ON NEW YEAR'S -- SO Buy- 
ING MY OWN COPIES WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION, BEING FORCED 
TO STRETCH OUT MY NEW YEAR'S MONEY TO LAST AN ENTIRE 
YEAR DION’T LEAVE ME ANY FUNOS FOR A WEEKLY PUBLICATION, 
EVEN ONE THAT ONLY COST [70 YEN PER ISSUE. 


AT FIRST, DRAGON BALL WAS MY SOLE REASON FOR READING 
JUMP, BUT EVENTUALLY | BEGAN TO REALIZE HOW INTERESTING 
A NUMBER OF THE OTHER TITLES IN THE ANTHOLOGY WERE. 
| STARTED FOLLOWING JOJO'S BIZARRE ADVENTURE, SAINT 
SEIYA (KNIGHTS OF THE ZODIAC), HIGH SCHOOL KIMENGUM! 
ANO OTHERS, ANO BECAME A FAN OF JUMP ITSELF. ONCE | 
REALIZED HOW FUNNY MANGA WERE AND HOW MUCH | LIKED 
THEM, | BEGAN TO ASPIRE TO BECOME A MANGA ARTIST... 
ANC TO CREATE A SERIAL OF MY OWN THAT COULD APPEAR 
IN JUMP. AND | CLEARLY RECALL THAT THE FIRST MANGA 
EVER DREW WAS 'HIATARI-KUN," A SERIES ABOUT THE ADVEN- 
TURES OF A MYSTERIOUS YOUNG NINJA.

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, FART 71 


SO MUCH HAPPENED DURING MY FINAL YEARS OF ELEMEN- 
TARY SCHOOL THAT THERE'S STILL ALOT TO WRITE ABOUT, 
SO I'LLCONTINUE... 


"(0 BECOME SO OBSESSED WITH DRAGON BALL THAT, BE- 
FORE | HAD EVEN REALIZEO IT, MY OWN ART HAD BEGUN TO 
SO COMPLETELY MIMIC THE STYLE OF TORIYAMA AKIRA'S 
ARTWORK THAT MY DRAWINGS LOOKED JUST LIKE HIS. 


AROUND THAT TIME, LOOKING AT THE VIDEO GAME NEWS IN 
SHONEN JUMP’S GAME GUIDE INSERT, | SAW ILLUSTRATIONS 
THAT LOOKED JUST LIKE MR. TORIYAMA’S. 


"WHATEVER IT IS, THIS GAME LOOKS AWESOME!" | THOUGHT, 
AND WHEN | PERUSED THE COLUMN MORE CLOSELY AND 
REALIZED THAT MR. TORIYAMA HAD DESIGNED THE CHARAC- 
TERS, | GOT VERY EXCITED. THAT GAME, NEEOLESS TO SAY, 
WAS DRAGON QUEST. | REALLY WANTED TO PLAY IT, BUT BACK 
THEN THAT WAS AN UNREACHABLE DREAM FOR ME. AT THAT 
TIME, | DION’T EVEN HAVE A FAMICOM ("FAMILY COMPUTER"-- 
THE ORIGINAL NINTENDO GAME SYSTEM) THOUGH MOST OF 
MY CLASSMATES DIO OWN ONE. 


BEGGING MY PARENTS WOULON’T HAVE WORKED, BECAUSE 
MY FATHER WAS VERY STRICT. IF | SO MUCH AS BREATHED THE 
WORD "GAME," HE'D LECTURE ME AND TELL ME TO GO STUDY. 
THAT'S WHEN My LITTLE TWIN BROTHER HAD AN INCREDIBLE 
EPIPHANY AND SAID, "OUR ONLY HOPE IS TO HAVE SOMEONE 
GIVE US A FAMICOM!!" AND HE STARTED NEGOTIATING WITH 
SOME OF OUR FRIENOS WHO HE THOUGHT WERE LIKELY 
PROSPECTS. | DOUBTED THAT ANY OF THOSE KIDS WOULD 
JUST GIVE AWAY SOMETHING THAT COST OVER 10,000 YEN 
(ABOUT 100 U.S. DOLLARS)... UNTIL... VOILA! ONE OF OUR 
FRIENDS ACTUALLY PRESENTED US WITH HIS FAMICOM! 

IN THAT MOMENT, THAT KIO’S GENEROSITY MADE HIM SEEM 
LIKE AGOD TO ME!

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, PART 72 


WE HARASSED MY FATHER RELENTLESSLY UNTIL HE CAVED 
AND FINALLY LET US BUY DKAGON QUEST. IN FACT, IT WAS THE 
FIRST SOFTWARE | EVER PURCHASED, EVERYTHING ABOUT 
THE EXPERIENCE WAS NEW AND OIFFERENT. IT WAS THE FIRST 
ROLE-PLAYING GAME INTRODUCED FOR THE NINTENDO FAMI- 
COM (‘FAMILY COMPUTER") GAMING SYSTEM... AND | WAS 
COMPLETELY AT SEA ABOUT ALOT OF HOW IT WORKED, EVEN 
AFTER STUDYING THE MANUAL. THERE I'D BE, LOCKED IN 
BATTLE WITH SLIME, AND UP WOULD POP A MESSAGE 
CONGRATULATING ME ON HAVING MASTERED THE HOIMI 
HEALING SPELL NEEDED TO COMBAT IT. BUT | DION’T HAVE A 
CLUE WHAT TO OO WITH IT. ACCORDING TO THE MANUAL, YOU 
WERE SUPPOSED TO CHANT THE HOIMI AND ALL OF YOUR ‘HIT 
POINTS” WOULD BE RESTORED, BUT THERE WAS NO HINT OF 
HOW TO DO THAT. LUCKILY, SOMEHOW My LITTLE BROTHER 
HAD SOME KINO OF FLASH OF INSIGHT AND FIGURED OUT 
THAT WE SHOULD FLIP THE SWITCH ON THE BUILT-IN MICRO- 
PHONE IN THE SECOND CONTROLLER. AS SOON AS HE HAD IT 
TURNED ON, MY BROTHER YELLED “HOIMI!!” RIGHT INTO THE 
SECONDARY CONTROLLER'S MIKE!!

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, FART 7.3 


NOWADAYS, EVERY GAMER |S FAMILIAR WITH COMMAND- 
CONTROLLED ROLE-PLAYING VIDEO GAMES... BUT WHEN 
ORAGON QUEST CAME ALONG, NO ONE HAD EVER SEEN 
SUCH A THING. IT SEEMED COMPLETELY ALIEN TO ME, 
ANO |! HAD TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING IT. EVENTUALLY, 
THOUGH, MY BROTHER AND | LEARNED (OR THOUGHT WE 
HAD) THE SKILLS NECESSARY FOR COMPLETE MASTERY 
OF THE GAME. SO ONE DAY, WE WERE BLISSED OUT PLAy- 
ING DRAGON QUEST FOR ABOUT A FOUR-HOUR STRETCH... 
AND THEN, BEING IDIOTS, WE SHUT THE SYSTEM OFF BE- 
FORE REALIZING WE HAD NEVER BOTHERED TO FIND OUT 
ABOUT THE ALL-IMPORTANT "SPELL FOR RESTORING LIFE" 
COMMAND. WE WERE UTTERLY DESPONDENT, BUT THEN 
MY FATHER SHOWED UP AND SURPRISED US BY ASKING TO 
TRY OUT THE GAME HIMSELF. WE WERE SO EXCITED THAT 
HE WANTED TO JOIN IN THE FUN, AND ONE OF MY FONDEST 
MEMORIES |S OF THE THREE OF US PLAYING DRAGON 
QUEST |N AN ALL-NIGHT MARATHON SESSION, 


MY FATHER, WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY SHOWN A COMPLETE 
LACK OF INTEREST IN GAMES, FELL DEEPLY IN LOVE WITH 
ORAGON QUEST, WHICH KINO OF AMAZED ME, BECAUSE 
FOR ME IT WAS ONLY A PASSING FANCY. THE GAME WAS A 
HUGE SUCCESS AND HAS CONTINUED TO SPAWN SEQUEL 
AFTER SEQUEL. IN FACT, THE LAST TIME | CALLED MY FAR- 
ENTS (A RARE OCCURRENCE THESE DAYS), MY FATHER 
ANSWERED THE PHONE ANO WE TALKED FOR SOME TIME. 
IT SEEMS HE HAS JUST COMPLETED DRAGON QUEST 7.
