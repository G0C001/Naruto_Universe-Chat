Naruto is really starting to 
enter its climax. It’s gone on 
longer than | expected, but it’s 
definitely inching closer to the 
finale. This volume’s cover is an 
updated version of the chapter 
Li title page illustration from 
volume 1. The image | thought up 
back then is finally coming true 
in this volume... 





— Masashi Kishimoto, 2013 























Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

— THE STORY SO FAR... 


Naruto, the biggest troublemaker at the Ninja Academy in the 
Village of Konohagakure, finally becomes a ninja along with his 
classmates Sasuke and Sakura. They grow and mature through 
countless trials and battles. However, Sasuke, unable to give up his 
quest for vengeance, leaves Konohagakure to seek Orochimaru and 
his power... 

Two years pass. Naruto grows up and engages in fierce battles 
against the Tailed Beast-targeting Akatsuki.And the Fourth Great 
Ninja War against the Akatsuki finally begins. Naruto and his 
companions face off against the reunited Obito and Madara in order 
to stop the resurrected Ten Tails! Meanwhile, Sasuke borrows the help 
of a revived Orochimaru to bring back the previous Hokage using 
Edotensei.After hearing the truth about the village and what shinobi 
are from Senju Hashirama, Sasuke adopts his brother's will and 
decides to head to the battlefield to protect his village!!

MEET MASASHI KISHIMOTO’S ASSISTANTS, PART 13 
Assistant No. 13: Takahiro Hiraishi 


PROFILE 

* An indulgent parent who can't stop grinning when talking about his kids. 

* More scheming and wicked than first thought. 

- A basketball player who looks a lot like Japanese National Soccer Team 
goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima... So complicated. 

- We're treating him like a newbie here, but it’s actually been quite a while since he 
entered the workplace... He loves basketball but looks like the captain of Tomica 
Hero Rescue Force and was annoyed because | wasn't getting around to assistant 
introductions... So complicated. 

- In short, this means GK Eiji Kawashima and the Rescue Force captain also look 
alike, but...he’s right between the two of them. 

- Always walks around on the tips of his toes. 

* Fundamentally nice.
