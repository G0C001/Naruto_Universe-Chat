—Masashi Kishitmoto, 2077 





Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

THE STORY SO FAR... 


Naruto, the biggest troublemaker at the Ninja Academy in the Village 
of Konohagakure, finally becomes a ninja along with his classmates 
Sasuke and Sakura. They grow and mature through countless trials and 
battles. However, Sasuke, unable to give up his quest for vengeance, 
leaves Konohagakure to seek Orochimaru and his power... 

Two years pass. Naruto grows up and engages in fierce battles against 
the Tailed Beast-targeting Akatsuki. Elsewhere, after winning the heroic 
battle against Itachi and learning his older brother's true intentions, 
Sasuke allies with the Akatsuki and sets out to destroy Konoha. 

Upon Madara’s declaration of war, an Allied Shinobi Force is formed. 


As tensions rise in both camps, the Akatsuki pinpoint Naruto's location. 


Madara directs Kabuto to capture Nine Tails. Yamato heads out to 
intercept Kabuto and protect Naruto, but is captured instead!

REVIVE HIM FOR YOU...

IT INVOLVES 
SUMMONING A

IMPURE 


Y 


IN ORDER TO 
ACHIEVE THAT, 
A CERTAIN 
AMOUNT OF 
FLESH... 


FROM THE BODY 
OF THE PERSON 
YOU WANT TO 
REVIVE IS 
NECESSARY. 









JUST SO YOU 
KNOW... THE

CATEGORIZED 
AS A TYPE OF 
SUMMONING 
JUTSU... 





























LORO 
OROCHIMARU

FAILED... 






.._BECAUSE THE 
GOD OF DEATH 
NOW HAS HIS SOUL 
AFTER HE USED 
THE REAPER 
OEATH SEAL 
SEALING JUTSU. 





«TAKING THE 
SOULS OF THE 
FIRST AND 
SECOND HOKAGE 
WITH HIM. 


BUT HARVESTING 
THEIR PERSONAL 
INFORMATION 
MATERIAL WAS A 
REAL ORDEAL... 


I REVIVED 
NUMEROUS 
INDIVIDUALS 





OPERATION 


ANY TISSUE 
THAT 
CONTAINS 
PERSONAL

IN AODITION, THOSE 
WHOSE SOULS DO NOT 
OWELL IN THE PURE 
LAND... FOR EXAMPLE, 
THEIR SOULS ARE 
SEALED AWAY SOME- 
WHERE ELSE, ALSO 
CANNOT BE REVIVED. 


IF NONE 
EXISTS, 
THAT PERSON 
CANNOT BE 
REVIVED 
WITH THE
