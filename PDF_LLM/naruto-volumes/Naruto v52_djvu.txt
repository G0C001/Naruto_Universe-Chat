SHONEN. 





One member of my family is our pet 
cat Shi-san. He's quite elderly, so 
he can't get around much. In fact, he 
Sleeps most of the time. He's always 
asleep, even during the daytime, but 
it must get too bright, because he'll 
cleverly cover both eyes with his arm. 
That gesture is just so cool. 





—Masashi Kishittoto, 2070 


Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

THE STORY SO FAR... 


Naruto, the biggest troublemaker at the Ninja Academy in the Village of 
Konohagakure, finally becomes a ninja. Along with his classmates Sasuke 
and Sakura, he grows and matures during countless trials and battles. 
Sasuke, unable to give up his quest for vengeance, leaves Konohagakure 
to seek the renegade ninja Orochimaru, from whom he hopes to gain 
immense power. 

In the years that pass, Naruto engages in fierce battles against the Tailed 
Beast-targeting Akatsuki. Elsewhere, after winning the heroic battle against 
Itachi and learning his older brother's true intentions, Sasuke allies with the 
Akatsuki organization and sets out to destroy Konoha. 

Upon Madara’s declaration of war, each shinobi village leader prepares to 
form an Allied Shinobi Force. Meanwhile, Sasuke finally gets to defeat one 
of his enemies; Danzo falls at his hands. Sakura tries to stop the vengeance- 
obsessed Sasuke, but he turns his murderous intentions on her... Just then, 
Kakashi comes to the rescue!
