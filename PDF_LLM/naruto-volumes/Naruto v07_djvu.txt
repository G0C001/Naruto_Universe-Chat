Masashi Kishimoto wotmug 





This volume of Naruto is apparently the 
first to be created entirely digitally. 
My guess is that, in the future, manga 
production will continue to move 
further and further into this kind of 
Production and away from the more 
traditional methods. 
Both the backgrounds and the charac- 
ters themselves are created in soft- 
ware as polygons, and once the initial 
design and programming is done, any imaginable composition 
is possible. For action sequences, we use motion capture 
to create and manipulate the coolest poses we can come 
up with. It's all done on the computer, without using any 
paper or ink. Our methods will probably continue to change 
as the technology evolves... but there's one thing that 
won't ever change: the need to invent good stories! 
—Masashi Kishimoto, 2001 





Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (“Mechanism”). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

STORY AND ART BY 
MASASHI KISHIMOTO 


SAKURA 1777 


Smart and studious, Sakura 
is the brightest of Naruto's 
classmates, but she’s con- 
stantly distracted by her 
crush on Sasuke. Her goal: 
to win Sasuke’s heart! 


NARUTO JV b 


‘When Naruto was born, a 
destructive fox spirit was 
imprisoned inside his body. 
Spurned by the older vil- 
lagers, he’s grown into an 
attention-seeking trouble- 
maker. His goal: to become 
the village's next Hokage. 





SASUKE 1 A/7 


The top student in 
Naruto's class, Sasuke 
comes from the presti- 
gious Uchiha clan. His 
goal: to get revenge ona 
mysterious person who 
wronged him in the past. 








THE SOUND NINJA 


(OTONIN) 
These mysterious ninja are in the forest only 
to do their master Orochimaru’s bidding — 
to destroy Sasuke! 





MITARASHI ANKO 
BRELIFYA 


The Second Chief Examination Officer, proctor of 
the test in the Forest of Death! She tried hunting 
down Orochimaru herself, but since he slipped 
through her fingers, she has been waiting for the 
help of the elite Black Ops team she summoned.

ROCK LEE 





Rock Lee is one of the most talented young shinobi 
around, and he’s completely infatuated with Sakura. 
Separated from his teammates Neji and Tenten in the 
forest, he tried to act as Sakura's protector but was 
severely knocked around by the Sound Ninja. 


Watching from the sidelines as Lee and 
Sakura fight the Sound Ninja, they've been 
debating whether to get involved or stay in 
the shadows...but now Ino is jumping into 
the fray, coming to her rival Sakura’s aid! 


THE STORY SO FAR... 


Twelve years ago, a destructive nine-tailed fox spirit attacked the ninja village of Konohagakure. The 
Hokage, or village champion, defeated the fox by sealing its soul into the body of a baby boy. Now that 
boy, Uzumaki Naruto, has grown up to become a ninja-in-training, learning the art of ninjutsu with his 
classmates Sakura and Sasuke. 


Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura are deep in the Forest of Death, the site of the second stage of the Chinin 
(Journeyman Ninja) Selection Exam...but more urgent concerns have distracted them from collecting the 
scrolls they need to pass the test. After coming under the attack of the nefarious impostor Orochimaru, 
Naruto and Sasuke now lie unconscious on the forest floor. Mitarashi Anko, the exam proctor, chases after 

Orochimaru and learns his intentions: to mold Sasuke into his successor. ..assuming Sasuke survives the 
curse that Orochimaru placed on him. Orochimaru’s minions, the mysterious Sound Ninja, are also hunt- 
ing down Sasuke, and they're confused to discover that their leader has already caught his prey. But they're 
not prepared to back down, so the burden is on Sakura to defend her helpless teammates...

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, FART ONE: GROWING UP 


| WAS THE FIRST-BORN OF TWIN BROTHERS IN A TOWN IN 
OKAYAMA PREFECTURE IN 1974. | WAS EXTREMELY PREMATURE 
ANO HAD TO BE PUT INTO AN INCUBATOR AT ONCE. WITHOUT IT, 

| WOULD HAVE DIED. MY SURVIVAL WAS A VICTORY FOR SCIENCE. 
MY HOMETOWN HAS A TRADITION THAT PERSISTS TO THIS DAY 
WHERE, ON ONE’S FIRST BIRTHOAY, AMOCHI RICE CAKE IS 
PLACED UPON YOUR BACK AND THREE OBJECTS ARE PLACED 
BEFORE YOU. DEPENDING ON WHICH OF THOSE THREE A CHILD 
GRABS FIRST, THAT CHILO’S FUTURE FATH CAN BE DETERMINED. 
IN FRONT OF MY TWIN ANO I, OUR FARENTS PLACED AN ABACUS 
(TO REPRESENT SCHOLARSHIP), A BRUSH PEN AND MONEY. THE 
STORY IS THAT AFTER SOME HESITATION, MY YOUNGER BROTHER 
TOOK HOLD OF THE BRUSH PEN. ANO AT THAT SAME MOMENT, 
'M TOLO | UNHESITATINGLY WENT FOR THE CASH, LAUGHING 
ALL THE WAY. WHAT A BRAT! | MAY HAVE BEEN A MERCENARY BABY, 
BUT AS | GREW OLDER, MY INTERESTS TURNED TOWARD 
DRAWING... AS DID THOSE OF MY BROTHER. TO THIS DAY, THERE 
ARE TWO LARGE BROWN STAINS ON THE WALL OF MY FARENTS’ 
HOME. WHEN | ASKEO MY MOTHER ABOUT IT, SHE TOLD ME, 
“WHEN YOU TWO WERE BABIES, YOU USED THE POOP THAT HAD 
OOZED OUT OF YOUR DIAPERS TO DECORATE THE WALL. WE'VE 
TRIED TO WASH IT OFF TIME AND TIME AGAIN, BUT THE STAIN 
REMAINS.” THAT’S WHEN | REALIZED I'D WANTED TO BE AN ARTIST

THE WORLO OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, PART TWO: STARTING SCHOOL 


WHEN | WAS OLD ENOUGH TO GO TO KINDERGARTEN, | BECAME INTERESTED 
IN A WHOLE VARIETY OF NEW THINGS. BUGS, THE FLOW OF ARIVER.. 

IF SOMETHING CAUGHT MY ATTENTION, IT WOULD HOLD My FOCUS UNTIL 
SOMEONE INTERRUPTED ME. I’M TOLD MY MOTHER ANDO MY TEACHERS HAD TO 
COME LOOKING FOR ME ALL THE TIME. AT HOME, | OID THE SAME THING. 
WHEN | WAS WATCHING TV, ‘0 TUNE OUT THE REST OF THE WORLD, EVEN IF 

MY FATHER CALLED ME BY MY PET NICKNAME, MABO, AND PHYSICALLY TURNED 
My FACE SO HE COULD SEE ME--UNDERSTANDABLY WANTING HIS CHILD TO FAY 
ALITTLE ATTENTION TO HIM--| STILL CONCENTRATED ON THE SCREEN. HE 
SAYS THAT MY FOCUS REMAINED SO COMPLETELY ON THE TV AND MY FACE 
GOT SO INTENSE THAT IT WASA LITTLE SCARY. AND IT MADE HIM ENVY THE 
TELEVISION, BACK THEN, TV WAS THE MOST INCREDIBLY THRILLING, STIM- 
ULATING THING | COULD IMAGINE. ONE OF MY FAVORITES WAS "DORAEMON." 

I WOULD DRAW THAT CHARACTER'S FACE OVER AND OVER AGAIN, NO MATTER 
WHERE | WAS. ACTUALLY, ALL MY KINDERGARTEN CLASSMATES LOVEO DORAE- 
MON, TOO, AND ALSO USED TO TRY AND DRAW HIM WITH ME. BUT | WAS A TOTAL 
STICKLER ABOUT IT, ESPECIALLY ABOUT THE WAY THE CHARACTER'S EYES HAD 
TO BE DRAWN. THE DIAGRAMS BELOW SHOW WHAT | MEAN. EVERYONE KEPT 
ORAWING THE CHARACTER THE WAY HE LOOKS IN FIGURE 2...BUT FIGURE 1 IS 
THE VERSION THAT’S CORRECT! | ALWAYS POINTED THAT OUT TO THEM AND 
LECTURED THEM ABOUT THE RIGHT WAY TO OO IT. IN RETROSPECT, |’D HAVE 
TO SAY | WAS AN OBNOXIOUS LITTLE PERFECTIONIST. BACK THEN, | EVEN 
CONDEMNED ANYONE WHO USED THE "DORAEMON DRAWING SONG" TO 
ORAW DORAEMON AS AHERETIC! 


‘EDITOR'S NOTE: "THE DORAEMON DRAWING SONG" (OR "DORAEMON NO 
O-EKAKI UTA" ) GIVES STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS FOR HOW TO DRAW 
DORAEMON; PRESUMABLY, USING THE SONG SEEMED LIKE A COP-OUT 
TO THE KINDERGARTEN-AGED KISHIMOTO.

MY PERSONAL HISTORY, PART THREE: PRIMARY SCHOOL 


AS AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLER, | SPENT ALOT OF 
TIME EVERY DAY DOODLING IN MY “ANYTHING GOES” 
SKETCHBOOK. EVEN WHEN | WAS OUT ON THE PLAY- 
GROUND PLAYING TAG, | ALWAYS HID REALLY WELL IN 
HOPES THAT WHOEVER WAS “IT” WOULDN'T FIND ME 
ANO SAT QUIETLY, DRAWING DORAEMON IN THE DIRT. 


THEN ONE SUCH DAY, | SAW AN AMAZING TV SHOW. 
‘WHAT IN THE WORLD |S IT?” | WONDERED, “IT’S SO 
COOL, AND THE ARTWORK IS AWESOME.” THE SHOW 
WAS... “MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM.” AFTER THAT, MY 
SKETCHBOOK WAS ALWAYS CRAMMED WITH DRAWINGS 
OF ROBOTS CALLED MOBILE SUITS. ZAKU, GOUF, DOM, 
GM, ODOZLE ZABI...| FEVERISHLY DREW ALL KINDS OF 
GUNDAM CHARACTERS. 


THEN ON ANOTHER DAY, | SAW ANOTHER INCREDIBLE 

TV SHOW AND THOUGHT, ‘W-WOW! THE ART IS AMAZING!

\ THOSE ARE THE 























THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, PART 4: GRADE-SCHOOL OBSESSIONS 


BY THE MIDOLE OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, MWY INTEREST HAD 
GROWN TO INCLUDE SCULPTING AND MODEL-MAKING. INITIALLY, 

ANY TIME MY FARENTS WOLLON'T BUY ME A TOY | REALLY WANTED, 

\'D MAKE IT FOR MYSELF OUT OF CLAY. BUT THAT DION’T SATISFY 

ME FOR LONG, SO | TURNED TO THE PLASTIC MOCELS BASED ON 
THE GUNDAM SERIES -- GUNPLA (GUNDAM PLASTIC) FOR SHORT. 

| GOT SOME FOR ANEW YEAR'S GIFT AND ASSEMBLED THEM IN 

AN ABSOLUTE FRENZY. THE NEXT FAD WAS PLAMORAJICON (OR 
PLARAJI) -- RADIO-CONTROLLED PLASTIC MODEL VEHICLES -- AND 

| JUMPED ON THAT PONY AS WELL (IN AMERICA, THESE WERE 
CALLED R/C CARS). 

| NAMED MY PLARAJI “THE ELEPHANT,” MADE AN ELEPHANT- 
SHAPED DECAL OUT OF SHEET PLASTIC, STUCK IT ON, AND RACED 
IT... DUE, NO DOUBT, TO THE INFLUENCE OF APOPULAR MANGA OF 
THE TIME CALLED “RAJICON BOY.” THE PLARAJI | OWNED WAS 
BASED ON THE MITSUBISHI PAJERO, BUT IT WASN'T VERY FAST, AND 
WAS CONSTANTLY BEING OVERTAKEN BY THE PLARAJIS OF MY 
LITTLE BROTHER AND ALL OF MY FRIENDS. THIS ANNOYED ME VERY 
MUCH, SO | REMODELED MY PAJERO WITH THE "GRASSHOPPER 
UPGRADE KIT," WHICH WAS ACTUALLY DESIGNED FOR A DIFFERENT 
MODEL ENTIRELY. | MELTED THE FAJERO’S PLASTIC CHASSIS WITHA 
SOLDERING IRON -- NEVER GIVING A THOUGHT TO THE TOXIC FUMES 
BEING RELEASED INTO THE UNVENTILATEDO LITTLE ROOM -- AND 
WAS ECSTATIC WHEN | SUCCEEDED IN MAKING THE UPGRADE. BUT 
MY IDIOTIC ELATION WAS SHORT-LIVED, AS NEW PROBLEMS QUICKLY 
UNFOLDED! 

BECAUSE | HAD FORCIBLY WELDED INCOMPATIBLE FARTS ONTO 

MY CAR, THE FAJERO'S BODY NO LONGER FIT WELL ONTO THE 
CHASSIS. | WAS TERRIBLY DEPRESSED OVER THE IRREVERSIBLE 
OAMAGE |'D DONE TO MY CAR, WITH THE BODY LEANING OFF THE 
CHASSIS AT ABOUT A TEN-ODEGREE ANGLE, BUT | INSISTED THAT 
APPEARANCE MEANT NOTHING. A PLARAJI SHOULD BE JUDGED BY 
HOW IT PERFORMS, NOT HOW IT LOOKS! BUT WHEN WE RACED 
AGAIN, THE OTHERS OUTMATCHED MY POOR LITTLE CAR IN BOTH 
SPEED AND APPEARANCE. 

UNOAUNTED EVEN AFTER GETTING HIT WITH THIS ONE-TWO 
COMBINATION OF DISAPPOINTMENTS, | MANAGED TO GET MY 
HANOS ON AN INCREDIBLE MOTOR CALLED THE "BLACK MOTOR 
ANGELS" AND INSTALLED IT IN THE FAJERO. “I'LL NEVER LOSE AGAIN!” 
| SAID, AND FINALLY WON THE RACING VICTORY THAT HAD BEEN MY 
HEART'S DESIRE. BUT THE MOTOR WAS SO POWERFUL THAT SUD- 
OENLY SMOKE BEGAN POURING OUT OF THE CONTROLS. THE 
PAJERO WOULD NEVER ENTER ANOTHER RACE. | KEPT IT ON DISPLAY 
IN MY ROOM, BUT IN MY HEART | WAS DESPONDENT AND FULL OF 
REGRET ABOUT EVER HAVING TRIED THE GRASSHOPPER UPGRADE 
KIT.
