4SO yen (with tax)... 

PLEASE | truly apologize for this affront. | 
FORGIVE ME! had decided that this (241) was the 
right number of pages to bring you, 
the readers, the Sasuke vs. Itachi 
arc. But this resulted in the price of 
the tankobon [graphic novel] going 
up, for which | feel absolutely terri- 
ble. This volume is also a bit thicker, 
but | do hope that you will read it 
to the very end. 





—Masashi Kishitoto, 2008 


Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

THE STORY SO FAR... 


Once the bane of the Konohagakure Ninja Academy, Uzumaki Naruto now serves 
dutifully among the ranks of the Konoha shinobi—an illustrious group of ninja sworn 
to protect their village from the forces of evil seeking to destroy it from without and 
within... 

However, Sasuke, unable to give up his quest for vengeance, leaves Konohagakure 
to seek Orochimaru and his power... 

Two years pass. Naruto and his comrades grow up and head out once more. As 
their fierce battles against the Tailed Beast-targeting Akatsuki rage on, Sasuke rebels 
against Orochimaru and takes everything from him. Sasuke then gathers new compan- 
ions and chases after Itachi. Jiraiya, the man who has trained Naruto for more than 
two years to deal with the impending attack of the Akatsuki, finally discovers the 
identity of the Akatsuki leader, Pain, and the secret is then bequeathed to Naruto— 
after Jiraiya’s untimely death. Sasuke once again confronts his brother Itachi and 
learns not only about his brother's true intentions, but also about the Uchiha Clan’s 
past. And to slake his vengeance, Sasuke challenges him to a battle. Confident that he 
can win, Sasuke appears to overpower and corner his brother... but then Itachi 
begins to unleash the full power of the Amaterasu...
