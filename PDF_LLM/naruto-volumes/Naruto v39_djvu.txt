Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

Once the bane of the Konohagakure Ninja Academy, 
Uzumaki Naruto now serves dutifully among the ranks of the 
Konoha shinobi—an illustrious group of ninja sworn to 
protect their village from the forces of evil seeking to destroy 
it from without and within... 






a | 





While the threat of the criminal organization known as the 
Akatsuki looms ever-present, Naruto’s former classmates— 
Shikamaru, Choji and Ino—embark on a mission to find 
Captain Asuma’s killer. And when their quest brings them 
into conflict with Kakuzu—one of the Akatsuki’s deadliest 
members—it’s Naruto who takes the enemy down with a 
display of power that rivals even the Fourth Hokage himself! 

















Meanwhile, Uchiha Sasuke continues down the dark path 
he set out upon when he joined Lord Orochimaru, one of 
Konoha’'s greatest foes. Convinced he’s learned all he can 
from his dark master, Sasuke betrays and kills Orochimaru. 

With one of his goals accomplished, he begins assembling a 

team of powerful allies in order to achieve his ultimate goal— 
the destruction of his brother, Uchiha Itachi! Having enlisted 
the swordsman Suigetsu and the tracker Karin, there remains 
but one last person for him to recruit...
