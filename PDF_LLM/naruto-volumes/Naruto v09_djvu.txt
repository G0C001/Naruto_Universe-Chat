SHONENJIUMEJMANGA 
Story & Art by 


Masashi Kishimoto wating 


One day, after | bought a book for 
background research, | noticed it 
had a special feature on the artist 
Claude Monet. | actually have very 
little interest in paintings and 
painters, but ever since my student 
days, | loved the grand old man 
Monet—I! went to exhibits of his 
work and owned several books of 
his paintings. | envy Monet 
because, although in his later years he was virtually blind, 
he kept on painting right up until his death, and was able 
always to paint whatever he wanted. | would love to keep 
drawing whatever | want for the rest of my own life, too. 





—Masashi Kishitroto, 2007 


Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

THE STORY SO FARR... 


Twelve years ago, a destructive nine-tailed fox spirit attacked the ninja village of Konohagakure. The 
Hokage, or village champion, defeated the fox by sealing its soul into the body of a baby boy. Now 
that boy, Uzumaki Naruto, has grown up to become a ninja-in-training, learning the art of ninjutsu 
with his classmates Sakura and Sasuke. 


Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura (along with six other teams of student ninja) have moved on to 
the third portion of the Chinin (Journeyman Ninja) Selection Exam—a series of no-holds- 
barred, one-on-one bouts that begin with a set of preliminary matches.As the preliminaries 
continue, Sakura faces off against her rival, Ino! Although strategic taunting by Sakura seems to 
have sent her opponent over the edge, Ino craftily distracts Sakura long enough to trap her 
into succumbing to the Mind Transfer Technique (Shintenshin no Jutsu), Ino’s signature move! 
With Sakura under her control, Ino has all but won the match...or has she?!

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, FART 8 


| PLAYED SOFTBALL FOR A WHILE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, 
AND WHEN | ENTEREO MIDOLE SCHOOL, | DECIDED TO JOIN 
THE BASEBALL CLUB. MY YOUNGER TWIN WAS INTO BASEBALL 
AS WELL, SO WE JOINED THE CLUB TOGETHER.THIS WAS 
WHEN THE BASEBALL ANIME 7OL/CH WAS A MONSTER 
SUCCESS ALL OVER JAFAN. IT WAS CREATED BY MITSURU 
ADACHI, AND WAS A STORY ABOUT TWIN BROTHERS WHO 
JOIN A BASEBALL CLUB. IN THE END, THE YOUNGER 
BROTHER DIES, AND THE OLDER ONE |S INSPIRED TO REALLY 
STEP UP AND DO A GREAT JOB FOR HIS BROTHER'S SAKE. 
THE IDEALISM OF THAT THEME APPEALED TO ME 
TREMENDOUSLY AT THE TIME. 

AS AN ADOLESCENT, | GOT ALITTLE CONFUSED AND 
DECIDED THAT THE STORYLINE IN J7OLU/CH TRULY REFLECTED 
MY OWN LIFE, SO | BOUGHT AND VORACIOUSLY CONSUMED 
THE MANGA SERIES AS WELL AS THE ANIMATION. BUT MY 
FASSION FOR IT COMPLETELY COOLED DOWN WHEN MY 
LITTLE BROTHER RUDELY TOLD ME, "OUR BASEBALL 

CLUB REQUIRES YOU SHAVE YOUR HEAD TO GORIVGAA/ 
STANDARDS -- NO HAIR LONGER THAN A MILLIMETER... 

AND BY THE WAY, FOOL, WE BOTH SUCK AT BASEBALL." | HAD 
TO ADMIT HE WAS RIGHT, SO | SWITCHED MY ALLEGIANCE 

TO ANOTHER MANGA CALLED MENON DASA JAKYLIIEL/ -- 
"THE GLORIOUS #3 BASEBALL CLUB" AND CONVERTED 

TO THE ASUNARO CAMP -- THE ADMIRERS OF THAT 

SERIES' MAIN CHARACTER, ASUNARO.

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, FART 7 


FOR ME, JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL WAS ALL ABOUT BASEBALL, 
ANDO DURING EVERY SUMMER VACATION WE HAD TRAINING 
CAMP. AT OUR SCHOOL, THE ENTIRE BASEBALL CLUB WENT 

TO SHODO ISLAND, FAMOUS FOR ITS OLIVES ANO ITS MONKEYS. 
EVEN WHILE ON THE TRIP, EVERYONE WAS REQUIRED TO WEAR 
OUR BLACK SCHOOL UNIFORM FANTS WITH WHITE SHIRTS. 

THE NUMBER OF MEMBERS IN THE BASEBALL CLUB USUALLY 
TOTALED ABOUT 45, AND WE WOULO RENT A BUS AND SET 

OUT FOR CAMP WITH GREAT POMP AND SPLENDOR. 

WE HAD GOOD TIMES -- ANDO MORE THAN ALITTLE FAIN -- 
DURING OUR STAYS ON SHODO ISLAND, ANO IT WAS OUR 
TRADITION TO END THE EXPERIENCE EACH SUMMER BY 
CLIMBING THE LOCAL TOURIST RESORT'S "MONKEY MOUNTAIN" 
RIGHT BEFORE WE LEFT. 

IF | REMEMBER CORRECTLY, IT WAS WHEN | WAS IN THE 
EIGHTH GRADE THAT | WAS INVOLVED IN AN INCIDENT SO 
TERRIBLE THAT ITS INFAMY IS UNFARALLELED IN THE ANNALS 
OF THE TRAINING CAMP HISTORY -- A DISASTROUS EVENT THAT 
COULD HAVE GOTTEN ALOT OF PEOPLE KILLED, WHENEVER 

| RECALL WHAT | DID ANO WHAT HAPPENED | WISH | COULD 
FORGET... BUT I’M RUNNING OUT OF IDEAS FOR THIS FEATURE 
NOW, SO I'M GOING TO FINALLY TELL THE TALE...

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, FART [0 


... THE INFAMOUS INCIDENT... IT HAPPENED RIGHT 
AFTER THE END OF TRAINING CAMP, THE DAY THAT 
ALL 45 OF US IN THE BASEBALL CLUB CLIMWVBED 
THE RESORT’S MONKEY MOUNTAIN TOGETHER. 


TO BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING, AS WE STARTED TO 
CLIMB THE MOUNTAIN, WE SAW A PLACARD THAT 
SAID, “DO NOT LOOK THE WILD MONKEYS IN THE 
EYE. IT IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.” THE SIGN 
ALONE WAS ENOUGH TO GIVE US THE JITTERS, 
BUT AS WE CONTINUED UP THE 200-METER 
MOUNTAIN FATH WITH THE GLARING EYES OF VAST 
NUMBERS OF WILD MONKEYS UPON US, WE 
GOADED EACH OTHER FURTHER, SAYING STUFF 
LIKE, ‘WHOA! GETTING CLOSE TO MONKEYS IS 
SCARY! THEY'LL GET MAD IF YOU SO MUCH AS SPIT 
OUT YOUR GUM! AND THEY'VE GOT THESE HUGE 
FANGS, MAN. THEY ARE BAD NEWS!” ANDO SO ON 
ANDO SO FORTH... WE WERE GETTING THOROUGHLY 
FREAKED OUT. WHEN WE REACHED THE SUMMIT, 
THERE WERE ABOUT 100 TAME MONKEYS BEING 
MANAGED BY AN ANIMAL TRAINER, ANO THEY 
CAME OVER TO GREET US. UNLIKE THEIR WILD 
COUNTERPARTS THAT WE'D BEEN WARNED AGAINST, 
THESE TAME ONES WERE GENTLE, PEOPLE- 
FRIENDLY, SWEET MONKEYS, ACCORDING TO THEIR 
HANOLER. HE TOLD US THAT THERE WAS ONE 
ALPHA MALE AMONG THE SUMMIT MONKEYS, AND 
THEY SEEMED TO BE CREATING AN INDEPENDENT 
COLONY. AND THEN HE POINTEO THE BOSS MONKEY 
OUT TO US, NOT SURPRISINGLY, IT WAS HUGE... WE 
COULDN'T HELP NOTICING THE MANY SCARS THAT 
CRISS-CROSSED ITS BODY, EACH UNDOUBTEDLY 
REPRESENTING A VICTORY IN ONE OF THE 
HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT BATTLES IT HAD 
ENDURED ON ITS ROAD TO BECOME THE HEAD OF 
THE COLONY. WHILE | LOOKED UP AT THE ALPHA 
MONKEY, WHICH WAS SITTING FIRMLY ATOP A 
PROMINENT BOULDER, | NERVOUSLY EOGED 
TOWARD IT, WANTING TO GET A CLOSER LOOK. 


ANDO THAT WAS IT! 
THE MOMENT WHEN IT HAPPENED!!

| HADN'T BEEN LOOKING WHERE | WAS GOING, ANO | STEPPED 
RIGHT ON ONE OF THE YOUNG MONKEYS! 

THE POOR LITTLE MONKEY RAN OFF SCREAMING...ANO IN 
ALMOST THE SAME INSTANT, | FELT SOMETHING CLAMP ONTO 
MY BACK! | LOOKED OVER MY SHOULDER, AND TO MY HORROR, 
IT WAS THE LITTLE MONKEY'S MOTHER, BARING HER TEETH 
AND LOOKING DETERMINED TO TAKE A BITE OUT OF ME! ALL | 
COULD THINK WAS “I’M GOING TO BE EATEN!!” | OE SPERATELY 
TRIED TO SHAKE OFF THAT MOTHER MONKEY ANO RUN AWAY, 
BUT | LOST MY BALANCE AND FELL OVER. AS | SCRAMBLED TO 
GET BACK UP, | LOOKED UP AND SAW THAT THE ENORMOUS 
BOSS MONKEY HAD LEAPT FROM HIS BOULDER TO ATTACK ME! 
IT WAS LIKE HE HAD TRANSFORMED INTO A DRAGONBALL-STYLE 
SAIYAN MONSTER MONKEY, SO | TRULY THOUGHT | WAS GOING 
TO DIE. | TRIED AGAIN TO STAND AND RUN AWAY... BUT MY KNEES 
WERE LIKE RUBBER ANDO | COULD BARELY STAND! | THOUGHT 
THAT WOULD BE THE END FOR ME, BUT RIGHT THEN THE 
MONKEYS’ HANOLER TACKLED THE ALPHA MONKEY ANDO 
TRAPPED HIM. BEFORE THE RELIEF COULD EVEN FULLY 
REGISTER IN MY BRAIN, THE HANDLER GLARED AT ME WITH 

AN EXPRESSION THAT SCARED ME ALMOST AS MUCH AS THE 
HEAD MONKEY'S HAD ANO YELLED, “RUN!!” 

AS MY SENSES BEGAN TO RETURN TO ME, | LOOKED AROUND 
ANDO SAW A RIDICULOUS NUMBER OF MONKEYS CHARGING AT 
ME! “THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS TAME, FRIENOLY MONKEYS,” 

| THOUGHT, CRYING MY EYES OUT AS | RAN!! AND ON TOP OF ALL 
THAT, | SAW THE MOST UNBELIEVABLE THING: THE ENTIRE 
AMAUGH | CLUB WAS UNDER ASSAULT BY THE MONKEYS!! 

IT WAS AN AMAZING SIGHT. THERE WERE PLENTY OF OTHER, 
ORDINARY TOURISTS AROUND, AND THEY WERE BEING LEFT 
ALONE. WHY WERE THE MONKEYS ATTACKING ONLY THE 
BASEBALL CLUB?! THEN, THE OBVIOUS ANSWER CAME TO ME! 
WE ALL HAD THE SAME GORINGARI BUZZ-CUT HAIR AND WERE 
WEARING WHITE SHIRTS AND OUR BLACK SCHOOL UNIFORM 
FANTS. TO THE MONKEYS, WE PROBABLY LOOKED LIKE SOME 
WEIRD, SHAVED-HEADED, WHITE-AND-BLACK GANG OF INVADERS. 
IN ANY CASE, WE LEFT THE MONKEY MOUNTAIN JUST AS FAST 
AS WE COULD. ONCE WE WERE ALL SAFELY INSIDE THE BUS, 
EVERYONE WAS TRYING TO CATCH THEIR BREATH AND EXCITEDLY 
DISCUSSING THE INCIDENT, WONDERING WHY IT HAPPENED. IT 
OCCURRED TO ME THAT MY HAVING ACCIDENTALLY STEPPED 
ON THE LITTLE MONKEY WAS APRETTY JUICY TIOBIT... SO | 
CONFESSED, EXPECTING THE REST OF THE CLUB TO LAUGH. 
BUT NO ONE FOUND IT THE LEAST BIT FUNNY. 

(THIS IS A TRUE STORY!)
