There's something that | 
discovered only very recently, in 
regards to how | draw my manga 
drafts. | found a B lead 0.2 mm 
mechanical pencil very easy to 
draw with. And if | stick it ina 
pencil extender—that socket you 
put on the end of a pencil stub 
to keep using it—it’s even easier 
to draw with. It really reduces 
the time it takes me to complete 
a draft! 


—Masashi Kishimoto, 2014 





Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

THE STORY SO FAR... 


Naruto, the biggest troublemaker at the Ninja Academy in the 
Village of Konohagakure, finally becomes a ninja along with his 
classmates Sasuke and Sakura. They grow and mature through 
countless trials and battles. However, Sasuke, unable to give up his 
quest for vengeance, leaves Konohagakure to seek Orochimaru and 
his power... 

Two years pass. Naruto grows up and engages in fierce battles 
against the Tailed Beast-targeting Akatsuki.And the Fourth Great 
Ninja War against the Akatsuki finally begins. Obito absorbs the Ten 
Tails and summons forth the Divine Tree in order to activate the 
Infinite Tsukuyomi. However, during the battle, Naruto reminds Obito 
of the days when he wished to be Hokage. Now defeated, Obito tries 
to make amends for his mistakes, but Madara soon takes control of 
the situation and the war continues!
