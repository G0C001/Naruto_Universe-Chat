Masashi Kishimoto wotume 





Thanks to everyone's support, Naruto 
has finally become an animated series! 


| wrote in the first manga volume, “The 
first time | won an award...| was so 
happy." And when my first comic book 
was published, | was 10 times happier 
still. 


But the anime makes me 100 times 
happier! So please watch the Naruto 
anime avd/ keep reading the manga. 





Oh! But | guess I'm happiest knowing 
that people are still enjoying Naruto. 
Yup, that's it! 


—Masashi Kishitroto, 2002 


Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

SHONEN JUMP MANGA 


VOL. 14 
HOKAGE VS. HOKAGE!! 






STORY AND ART BY 
MASASHI KISHIMOTO 


SAKURA *}-77 3 


Smart and studious, Sakura 
is the brightest of Naruto's 
classmates, but she's 
constantly distracted by her 
crush on Sasuke. Her goal: 
to win Sasuke’s heart! 


NARUTO F)/ + 


When Naruto was born, a 
destructive fox spirit was 
imprisoned inside his body. 
Spurned by the older 
villagers, he’s grown into an 
attention-seeking trouble- 
maker. His goal: to become 
the village’s next Hokage. 





SASUKE 3-277 


The top student in 
Naruto's class, Sasuke 
comes from the presti- 
gious Uchiha clan. His 
goal: to get revenge ona 
mysterious person who 
wronged him in the past. 











The Third Hokage 
=REAG 

The leader of Konohagakure. 
He was retired, but stepped 
back into the position when 
the fourth Hokage was killed 
by the Nine-Tailed Fox. 





Shikamaru 277) 
One of Naruto's classmates. 
He specializes in the Shadow 
Possession technique, and is a 
skilled ninja despite his lazy 
demeanor. 


THE STORY SO FARR... 


Gaara fy HE 
Mysterious, bloodthirsty Gaara 
is one of the scariest — and 
strangely familiar — ninja Naruto 
has ever encountered. 





Pakkun 7\y77>/ 

A talking dog and excellent 
tracker who's also a loyal 
companion to Naruto's teacher 
Kakashi. Pakkun watches over 
his students whenever 


Kakashi can’t. 









: ie: 
Orochimaru Fc Hte FL 


A nefarious master of disguise 
with a master plan of total 
revenge against the Third 
Hokage — for what exactly we 
have yet to learn. 


) is 


Kakashi 77 2 
Although he doesn’t have an 
especially warm personality, 
Kakashi is protective of his 
students. 


Twelve years ago, a destructive nine-tailed fox spirit attacked the ninja village of 
Konohagakure. The Hokage, or village champion, defeated the fox by sealing its soul 
into the body of a baby boy. Now that boy, Uzumaki Naruto, has grown up to become 
a ninja-in-training, learning the art of ninjutsu with his teammates Sakura and Sasuke. 


The Chunin Exams come to a shocking conclusion! As Sasuke and Gaara face off, 
an invasion commences, halting the exams for good. Sasuke takes off after the 
fleeing Gaara, and Kakashi sends Naruto, Sakura and Shikamaru after him. As 

Chaos Spreads, Orochimaru, disguised as Kazekage, takes the Third Hokage 
hostage. Orochimaru’s Operation Destroy Konoha is under way, complete with 
a dastardly — and forbidden — secret weapon...

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, PART !7 


EVEN AS | WAS COMPLETING MY SECOND YEAR OF COLLEGE, 
| STILL COULON’T DRAW AN ADEQUATE MANGA. THAT'S WHEN 
| SUDDENLY ASKED MYSELF, “WHAT IS MANGA?” REALIZING 
THAT | HAD TO UNDERSTANO MANGA MORE THOROUGHLY, | 
OECIDEO THAT | NEEDED TO TAKE IT APART AND ANALYZE IT. 
SO | CAME TO KNOW THAT THE BASIC ELEMENTS OF MANGA 
ARE CHARACTERS, MOTIF, STORY, THEME, DIRECTION IN THE 
FORM OF PICTURE COMPOSITION (WIDE ANGLE, ZOOM IF 
USING CAMERA ANGLES AS AN ANALOGY), SOUND (SOUND 
EFFECTS), ACTION, EFFECTS, ONE-, TWO- AND THREE-POINT 
LINEAR PERSPECTIVE FOR THE BACKGROUND, ANDO THEN 
TIMING, SENSE, AND MANY OTHER FACTORS. AND WHILE MY 
COMPREHENSION WAS GREAT, AS | CONTINUED MY ANALYSIS | 
STARTEO SEEING MORE ANDO MORE THINGS THAT | WASN’T 
GOOD AT OR SKILLS THAT | LACKED. FEELING OVER- 
WHELMED BY THE AMOUNT OF LEARNING AND HONING | 
STILL HAD TO DO, | FELL INTO ASMALL FANIC. | BEGAN TO 
UNDERSTAND THAT UNLESS | COMPREHENOED AND 
MASTERED ALL THOSE FACTORS MYSELF, | COULON’T EVEN 
BEGIN TO DRAW EVEN A SIMPLE “WELL, IT’S KINDA INTEREST- 
ING” LIGHT-READ TYPE OF MANGA. 


SOMEHOW, | SUODENLY BECAME TERRIFIED OF MANGA, 
THINKING OF THEM AS MONSTERS, ANO BECAME AFRAID OF 
DRAWING MANGA. THAT FAINFUL PERIOD LASTED FOR 
SEVERAL MONTHS, AND JUST AS | WAS SLIDING INTO AN 
EMOTIONALLY ORAINEO STATE, A FRIEND OF MINE BOUGHT 
AN ISSUE OF JUMP ANDO STARTED READING SLAM DUNK IN MY 
ROOM... WHEN | LOOKED AT HIS FACE, | NOTICED THAT HE 
HAO AN AVID ANO HAPPY EXPRESSION. AND THEN, WHEN HE 
FINISHED THE CHAPTER, HE EXCLAIMED, “WOW! SLAM DLINK 
1S SO COOL!!”" 


SUDDENLY, | HAD AN URGE TO ASK HIM A QUESTION. THIS 
QUESTION WAS A REALLY SCARY QUESTION FOR ME TO ASK. 
FOR THAT FRIEND WAS ONE WHO WOULD NEVER LIE TO ME, 
ANO HE ALSO KNEW MANGA WELL. SO THIS IS WHAT | ASKED: 


“WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SLAM DUNK AND MY 
MANGA? WHY IS SLAM DLINK SO COOL ANDO INTERESTING?” 


OF COURSE, | MYSELF ALSO LOVED SLAM DUNK, AND WOULD 
BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT THAT IT WAS VERY INTERESTING! | 
JUST WANTED TO GET AN OUTSIDE, OBJECTIVE VIEW OF THE 
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SLAM DUNK AND MY MANGA. 

MY FRIEND REPLIED THUS: 


“YOU CAN TELL FROM READING IT HOW MUCH MR. INOUE 
TAKEHIKO REALLY LOVES BASKETBALL. AND YOU CAN FEEL 
HOW MUCH FUN HE HAS DRAWING SLAM DUNK, ANO IT’S LIKE 
MR. INOQUE’S DRAWING IT WITH THE MESSAGE ‘PLEASE READ IT, 
BASKETBALL IS LOTS OF FUN’ TO THE READERS. WITH YOUR 
MANGA, I'M SURE YOU'RE DRAWING BECAUSE YOU REALLY 
LOVE IT TOO, BUT IT’S JUST NOT COMING THROUGH AS FUN... 
IT’S LIKE, YOU'RE HAVING ALL THE FUN BY YOURSELF AND 
WE'RE BEING LEFT OUT OR LEFT BEHIND. THERE’S NO 

SENSE OF ‘PLEASE READ IT’...”

MY PERSONAL HISTORY, PART I? (CONTINUED) 


WHEN | HEARD THE TRUTH, IT DID OEFLATE ME, BUT | 
CONTINUED TO POSE THE SAME QUESTION TO OTHER 
FRIENOS OF MINE. ANO YET | KEPT GETTING SIMILAR 
RESPONSES FROM THEM AS WELL. 


AND THEN, IT CAME TO ME. THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT 
ELEMENTS TO DRAWING MANGA, BUT THE MOST IMPOR- 
TANT PRINCIPLE 1S... 


“ONE MUST HAVE FUN DRAWING ONE'S OWN MANGA. ANDO 
THEN, WHAT'S EVEN MORE CRITICAL IS TO BE AWARE OF 
ONE'S AUDIENCE AND DRAW FOR THE READERS’ ENJOY- 
MENT. EVERYTHING MUST BE FOR THE READERS. ONE 
MUST BE ABLE TO CHANGE THE EXPRESSIONS ON THEIR 
FACES AND MAKE THEM SAY ‘WOW! THAT IS SO COOL!’ 
WHEN THEY'VE FINISHED READING IT!!” 


AND AFTER A LITTLE WHILE, | REALIZED THAT THIS IS 
WHAT IS MEANT BY “ENTERTAINMENT.” IT’S IMPORTANT TO 
GRASP THE PRACTICAL ASPECTS OF DRAWING MANGA, 
BUT AS LONG AS ONE DRAWS THINKING “I’M GOING TO BE 
AN ENTERTAINER!!!” | FEEL THAT THE OTHER THINGS WILL 
QUIETLY AND NATURALLY FALL INTO PLACE.

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, FART 20 


AROUND THE TIME OF MY THIRD YEAR IN COLLEGE, | STARTED 
WATCHING MOVIES A LOT. THERE ARE VARIOUS FILM CONCEPTS THAT 
APPLY TO MANGA, SO THEY ARE GOOD REFERENCES. 


PERHAPS BECAUSE OF THAT, | STARTED RENTING VIDEOS MORE AND 
MORE, UNTIL | WAS WATCHING AT LEAST ONE MOVIE A DAY. EVENTU- 
ALLY, EVEN RENTALS WEREN'T ENOUGH, SO | STARTED GOING TO THE 
THEATER TO WATCH NEW RELEASES. ONE SUCH DAY, | STARTED 
HEARING RUMORS ABOUT THE BRAD PITT/MORGAN FREEMAN 
MOVIE “SEVEN.” IT WAS A BLOCKBUSTER HIT THAT WAS SECOND IN 
BOX OFFICE TICKET SALES IN 1776. A PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER 
WHOSE TITULAR THEME REFERS TO THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS, IT 
RAISED MY EXPECTATIONS QUITE A BIT. “THIS IS A MUST! I'VE GOT TO 
GET TO THE THEATER!” MY DETERMINATION AND ZEAL KEPT ON 
CLIMBING! | EVEN DECIDED TO GO TO THE SALON FOR A CUT 
BECAUSE MY BANGS HAD GROWN SO LONG | WAS AFRAID IT WOULD 
MAKE IT HARDER TO SEE THE MOVIE SCREEN. 


.«HOWEVER!! KISHIMOTO WAS NOT YET AWARE 
AT THIS TIME THAT A FRIGHTFUL INCIDENT 
WOULD TAKE PLACE AT THAT SALON!! 
OUN-DA-OUN-OUN~~~DUN!!! 


(I’M GOING TO STRETCH THIS OUT IN TYPICAL MYSTERY/SUSPENSE

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, PART 20 (CONTINUED) 


| WENT TO THE SALON TO GET MY BANGS TRIMMED, SO | SAT IN THE 
HAIRCUT SEAT. MY HEAD WAS FULL OF... “I’M GOING TO GO SEE 
SEVEN TOMORROW--! | WONDER WHAT THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS 
ARE--?! THE DIRECTOR |S DAVID FINCHER, SO | BET THE FRIGHT 
SCENES ARE GOING TO BE PRETTY AMAZING! WITH MORGAN 
FREEMAN AS THE VETERAN DETECTIVE AND BRAD PITT AS THE 
GREEN YOUNG DETECTIVE, WHAT A FANTASTIC TEAM! | HEARD IT 
HAS AN UNEXPECTED ENDING, A SUDDEN REVERSAL, BUT | WONDER 
WHAT IT |S...” | WAS ALL EXCITED. AND JUST AS THEY STARTED 
CUTTING MY HAIR, SOME WOMAN CAME IN FOR A HAIRCUT AND SAT 
DOWN IN THE NEXT CHAIR OVER. THIS WOMAN STARTED UP A 
FRIENOLY CHAT WITH HER STYLIST, BRAGGING, “| WENT ON A DATE 
YESTERDAY.” | HAD NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT WITH My STYLIST, SO | 
WAS SILENT ANO PRETENDED TO BE ASLEEP. TO MY DISGUST, THE 
LOUDMOUTHED WOMAN NEXT TO ME STARTED GOING INTO DETAILS 
ABOUT HER DATE. “GRODY~” | THOUGHT TO MYSELF, BUT... BECAUSE 
HER VOICE WAS SO LOUD, | ENDED UP HEARING HER BRAGGING TALE 
WHETHER | WANTED TO OR NOT. SUDDENLY, SHE STARTED SAYING 
SHE HAD GONE TO THE MOVIES WITH THIS GUY, ANO THAT THE FILM 
THEY HAD SEEN WAS THE CURRENTLY POPULAR SEVEN. 


JUST AS| WAS THINKING TO MYSELF “I'M GOING TO GO SEE IT TOO, 
TOMORROW...”, OH NO! THAT CHATTERBOX GIRL STARTED DESCRIB- 
ING THE PLOT OF SEVEN!! NEEDLESS TO SAY, SHE WAS LOUD!! | 
WANTED TO COVER MY EARS, BUT MY HANDS WERE UNDER THE 
CAPE BECAUSE | WAS GETTING MY HAIR CUT...!! AND SO, IN THAT 
MOMENT, | BEGGED THAT WOMAN... 


“PLEASE! THE CLINCHER... JUST DON'T SPILL THE CLINCHER, 
PLEASE~~~~~!!!” 


YANO WHAT WAS INSIDE THAT BOX. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT... |T WAS THE 
HEAD OF BRAD PITT’'S WIFE--! AND THEN--!” 


oe SHE HAD SPILLED IT... 


THE NEXT OAY,| DECIDED NOT TO GO SEE SEVEN... (| CAN JUST 
RENT THE VIDEO... ESPECIALLY NOW THAT | KNOW THE WHOLE 
STORY...) FURTHERMORE, THEY HAD CUT MY BANGS TOO MUCH AND | 
ENDED UP LOOKING LIKE A BUSINESSMAN.
