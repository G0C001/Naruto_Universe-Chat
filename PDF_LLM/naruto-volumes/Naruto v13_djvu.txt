Story & Art by 


Masashi Kishimoto 





Science Fiction movies are on the 
rise again...Right now they rank 
at the top of the box office in 
revenue, so | was thinking to 
myself, “Wow, everyone must really 
like Sci Fi...” and then | realized 
I'm one of those people too! 





—Masashi Kishitnoto, 2002 


Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

Smart and studious, Sakura

crush on Sasuke. Her goal: 
to win Sasuke’s heart!

When Naruto was born, a 
destructive fox spirit was 
imprisoned inside his body. 
Spurned by the older 
villagers, he’s grown into an 
attention-seeking trouble- 
maker. His goal: to become 
the village's next Hokage.

THE STORY SO FAR... 


‘Twelve years ago, a destructive nine-tailed fox spirit attacked the ninja village of Konohagakure. The 
Hokage, or village champion, defeated the fox by sealing its soul into the body of a baby boy. Now that 
boy, Uzumaki Naruto, has grown up to become a ninja-in-training, learning the art of ninjutsu with his 
teammates Sakura and Sasuke. 


During the Second Chinin Exam, in the Forest of Death, Naruto and the others were attacked 
by the mysterious shinobi Orochimaru, who left a curse mark on Sasuke and vanished... 


Now it’s the Chanin Exam finals! But Sasuke is missing! To prevent Sasuke from losing to Gaara 
by forfeit, the next two scheduled matches were moved up. Things went downhill from there: 
Kankuro withdrew from his match against Shino to reserve his secret moves for the coming 

coup. Shikamaru almost beat Temari, but called it quits at the last minute. But now, at last, it’s the 
fight you've all been waiting for...!

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, PART 16 


IN HIGH SCHOOL | WAS DRAWING MANGA ALL THE TIME, ANDO EVEN 
THOUGH | WAS IN THE PROGRESSIVE TRACK, MY HOMEROOM 
TEACHER TOLD ME | WOULDN'T GET INTO ANY COLLEGE BASED ON 
MY GRADES IN THE STANDARD SUBJECTS. “...” “.. HEH...” “SO WHAT!!” | 
OION'T PANIC! I'D ALREADY THOUGHT IT OUT ANO PLANNED AHEAD 
FOR THAT! AND WHAT WAS IT THAT | HAD IN MIND...? 


SINCE | WAS IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON, 
MY GRADES IN ART HAVE ALWAYS BEEN EXCELLENT! ...“THAT’S RIGHT! 
IF IT’S AN ART COLLEGE, | THINK | CAN GET IN!” THIS COMPLETELY 
GROUNOLESS CONFIDENCE HAD SECRETLY ALLAYEO MY FEARS! 


(P.S. BECAUSE IT WAS A PROGRESSIVE TRACK, THERE WERE NO ART 
CLASSES AT ALL!) MOST ART SCHOOLS ONLY TEST ART ON THEIR 
APPLICATION EXAMS. 


IN ANY CASE, TO BE HONEST, DESPITE THE FACT THAT | WAS CON- 
STANTLY DRAWING IN HIGH SCHOOL, | WAS FAINFULLY AWARE THAT | 
DION’T HAVE GOOD SKETCHING SKILLS. SO | SAID TO MYSELF, “I’LL 
HONE MY SKETCHING ABILITY IN COLLEGE!” ANO PRACTICED SKETCH- 
ING THE SAMPLE PLASTER MODELS BEFORE HEADING OFF TO THE 
ACTUAL EXAM! 


WHILE DEEPLY REALIZING THAT HUMANS ARE CREATURES OF CONVE- 
NIENCE WHO ONLY OFFER PRAYERS TO THE GODS WHEN FACED WITH 
CRISES, | WAITED SEVERAL WEEKS FOR THE RESULTS! 

A-AND THEN... THE GOOS HAON’T YET ABANDONED ME... 


| PASSED!! 


“YES!! NOW I CAN DRAW MANGA ALL I WANT!! YEAH!!" 
SO AMIDST HIGH STRESS, | WENT OFF TO ART SCHOOL! 


ANO THEN, BRIEFLY REFLECTING ON MY HIGH SCHOOL YEARS, | 
WONDERED THUSLY: FOR THREE YEARS, | HAD DESPERATELY STRUG- 
GLED THROUGH MATH, ENGLISH, GRAMMAR, CHEMISTRY, AND 
HISTORY... TO WHAT END?

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, FART !7 


HAVING BRILLIANTLY ACHIEVED COLLEGE STUDENT STATUS AND 
HAVING ALL OF MY CLASSES REVOLVE AROUND DRAWING MADE FOR A 
OREAMLIKE, HAPPY EXISTENCE FOR ME. 


AND NOW THAT | WAS A FIRST-YEAR COLLEGE STUDENT, | WAS ABOUT 
TO TURN I? YEARS OLD! | STARTED FURIOUSLY DRAWING MANGA, WITH 
JUMP’S HOP * STEP AWARD AS MY GOAL. “I FEEL A SAMURAI MANGA 
COMING ON RIGHT NOW!” | THOUGHT, SO | STEADILY DREW A SAMURAI 
MANGA, BUT THEN, JUST AS| WAS ABOUT TO COMPLETE IT, AN UNBE- 
LIEVABLE THING HAPPENED...!! 


YIKES! A DOUBLE PUNCH OF NEWCOMERS WHO WERE BOTH THINKING 
THE SAME THING AND HAD GOOD ART SENSE--| COULON'T BELIEVE 
THERE WERE SO MANY!! AND IN THIS WORLD, THE EARLY BIRD REALLY 
DOES GET THE WORM...! 


IN THE STANO-ALONE STORY SECTION OF JUMP APPEARED A MANGA 
BY RUROUNI KENSHIN AUTHOR WATSUK!I NOBUHIRO-SENSE!! AT THE 
TIME, THE TITLE DID NOT YET HAVE “KENSHIN” IN IT, BUT IT STILL HAD 
AHUGE EFFECT ON ME. IN ADDITION, AROUND THE SAME TIME, 
SAMURA HIROAKI OF THE IMMORTAL SAMURAI BLADE OF THE 
IMMORTAL FAME ALSO WON THE GRAND PRIZE AND FOREVER 
CHANGED THE STANDARD FOR AFTERNOON'S RISING ARTISTS’ 
CONTEST!! SAMURA'S ART ANDO STORY WERE WAY ABOVE THE LEVEL 
OF ANEWCOMER, ALMOST THAT OF A FULL PRO! 


| RECEIVED THE BIGGEST SHOCK OF MY LIFE SINCE AKIRA! 


WHEN | CAREFULLY REREAD MY OWN SAMURAI MANGA WITH THOSE 
TWO AMAZING WORKS IN FRONT OF ME, | FELT MY OWN PUNINESS 
MORE THAN | CARED TO... OF COURSE, | STILL ENTERED THAT 
SAMURAI MANGA INTO THE CONTEST, BUT IT DION’T EVEN MAKE A 
MARK... MY FATH TOWARDS BECOMING A MANGA-KA STILL STRETCHED 
FAR BEFORE ME, WROUGHT WITH PERIL!

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, FART 18 


| OION’T WIN THE CONTEST, SO | ENDED UP SPENDING MY 
FIRST YEAR OF COLLEGE PRETTY DISGRUNTLED. 


ONE DAY, SOMEONE APPROACHED ME SAYING “I DRAW MANGA 
TOO” AND PROFFERED THIS: ‘IF YOU'LL DRAW MANGA FOR MY 
NEW COLLECTION, I'LL PAY YOU.” ‘WELL, IF | CAN GET MONEY 
FOR MY OWN PIECE, MIGHT AS WELL,” | THOUGHT, SO | QUICKLY 
PUT TOGETHER ROUGHLY EIGHT FAGES OF A RANDOM 
STAND-ALONE SHORT AND GAVE IT TO HIM. HE WAS PUTTING 
TOGETHER A DOJINSHI (SELF-PUBLISHED WORK) WITH 
ABOUT FIVE PEOPLE IN TOTAL, AND HAD COME TO COMMIS- 
SION ME TO BE ONE OF THE FIVE, HAVING HEARD A RUMOR 
THAT | OREW MANGA. SINCE THE DEAL WAS THAT | WOULD GET 
AN EQUAL SHARE OF THE PROFIT, | PLEASANTLY LOOKED 
FORWARD TO THE BOOK’S COMPLETION. BUT NO MATTER 
HOW LONG | WAITED, NO BOOK! 


AFTER | HAD WAITED A LONG WHILE, | ASKED THE FELLOW “SO 
WHEN IS THE BOOK COMING OUT?” BUT HE ANSWERED, 
“THREE OTHER MANGA, INCLUDING MY OWN, ARE STILL NOT 
DONE...” | REALLY WANTED TO SHOUT BACK, "HOW CAN IT TAKE 
YOU MORE THAN FOUR MONTHS TO COMPLETE EIGHT 
PAGES!” BUT INSTEAD | JUST MUTTERED ‘AH, | SEE” AND 
ENTERED A STATE OF RESIGNATION. THE NEXT TIME | SAW 
HIM HE HAD HIS BACK TO ME, FURIOUSLY PLAYING VIDEO 
GAMES AT THE ARCADE. THAT’S WHEN IT FINALLY HIT ME (AAH! 
HE’S A SHAM MANGA ARTIST). 


HOWEVER, THIS WORLO IS NOT MADE UP OF JUST SHAM 
MANGA ARTISTS! A CERTAIN FAIR OF SENPAI (UPPERCLASS- 
MEN) WOULO END UP TRANSFORMING MY DISGRUNTLED LIFE 
WHEN | ENTEREO MY SECOND YEAR OF COLLEGE! THOSE 
TWO COMPETED AGAINST EACH OTHER, COLLECTING 
NEWCOMER AWARDS LEFT ANO RIGHT, AND WERE VETERANS 
ENOUGH TO ALREADY HAVE ASSIGNED EDITORS, EVEN 
CUTTING BACK ON SLEEP TO INCREASE THEIR TIME SPENT 
ORAWING MANGA. “YES! FINALLY, I'VE MET GENUINE MANGA 
ARTISTS!” | JOYFULLY SAID TO MYSELF, FREQUENTLY RUNNING 
OVER TO MY SENFAI'S HOUSES TO HANG OUT AND LEARN ALL 
ABOUT MANGA PRODUCTION! THEY WERE ALSO WILLING TO 
READ MY MANGA ANDO GIVE ME ALL SORTS OF CRITIQUES SO 
THAT MY SKILLS WERE HONED! | AM SO ETERNALLY GRATEFUL 
TO THOSE TWO. EVEN NOW, THEY LET ME CALL THEM ON 
OCCASION... HOWEVER, | FEEL BAD ABOUT BOTHERING THEM, 
SO IT’S STILL HARD FOR ME TO PICK UP THE PHONE. FOR 
THEY'RE BOTH SLEEP-DEPRIVED PROFESSIONAL MANGA 
ARTISTS LEADING IRREGULAR LIVES!
