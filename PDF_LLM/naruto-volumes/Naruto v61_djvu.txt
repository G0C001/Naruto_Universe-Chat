— Masashi Kishimoto, 2012 


Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

THE STORY SO FA 

Naruto, the biggest troublemaker at the Ninja Academy in the Village of 
Konohagakure, finally becomes a ninja along with his classmates Sasuke and 
Sakura. They grow and mature through countless trials and battles. However, 
Sasuke, unable to give up his quest for vengeance, leaves Konohagakure to 
seek Orochimaru and his power. 

Two years pass. Naruto grows up and engages in fierce battles against the 
Tailed Beast-targeting Akatsuki. Elsewhere, after winning the heroic battle 
against Itachi and learning his older brother's true intentions, Sasuke allies with 
the Akatsuki and sets out to destroy Konoha. 

The Fourth Great Ninja War against the Akatsuki begins. The Allied Shinobi 
Forces begin to rally back after a series of unfavorable battles early on and 
have the Five Shadows assemble on the battlefield in order to stop the 
Edotensei-revived Madara! Naruto deepens his bond with Nine Tails and the 
other jinchuriki during his battle against the masked man. Meanwhile, Sasuke 
encounters a revived Itachi!
