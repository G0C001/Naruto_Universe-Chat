Story/& Art by, 








These days, | often hurt my 

| wrists when | wake up in the 
morning. When | sit up, | put 
too much weight on one hand 
and end up twisting it. You're 
not too aware of things when 

} you've just woken up. So, 
everyone please be careful when 
you wake up in the morning. 


—Masashi Kishitnoto, 2000S 


Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

Naruto, the biggest troublemaker at the Ninja 
Academy in the village of Konohagakure, finally becomes 
a ninja along with his classmates Sasuke and Sakura. 
Right in the middle of the Chinin Selection Exams, 
Orochimaru and his henchmen launch Operation 
Destroy Konoha, which ends when the revered leader 
of the village, the Third Hokage, sacrifices his own life 
to save his people. 


oxr4 













Tsunade, one of the Three Great Shinobi of Konoha 
legend, becomes the Fifth Hokage. Sasuke, succumbing 
to the allure of Orochimaru’s power, leaves the village 
with the deadly Sound Ninja Four. Naruto fights 

valiantly against Sasuke, but can’t stop him. 





Two years pass following that battle, and Naruto and 
his comrades train and mature. The mysterious Gaara 
becomes Kazekage and falls into the hands of the 
secret society of the Akatsuki! Naruto with one team 
and Lee with another set out for the village of Suna- 
gakure to save him!!

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY: 
FIGHTING AGAINST CHAOS, FART | 


THERE'S ONE THING | HAVE LEARNED FROM My SIX YEARS’ EXPERI- 
ENCE CREATING MANGA. WHAT'S THAT, YOU ASK...? 


IT |S THAT IF PEOPLE STAY IN ONE PLACE WITH THE SAME PEOPLE 
WITHOUT SLEEPING FOR ALONG PERIOD OF TIME, THEY WILL SLOWLY 
GO INSANE. THESE ARE SYMPTOMS THAT APPEAR AMONG MY ASSIS- 
TANTS: CRACKING UP OVER AN EXTREMELY LAME JOKE, SPENDING A 
HALF HOUR TAPE RECORDING FARTS, CONVERSING IN MOANING 
VOICES, AND SO ON. IN THESE WAYS AND COUNTLESS OTHERS, 
THINGS START GOING LOOPY. 


INA SENSE, MY ASSISTANTS COME TO BE CONTROLLED BY A KIND OF 
CHAOS, HOWEVER, THEY AREN'T AWARE OF IT, AND A STATE OF CHAOS 
BECOMES NORMAL... WHENEVER A NEW PERSON JOINS THE TEAM, 
THE GAP MY ASSISTANTS FEEL BETWEEN THEMSELVES AND THE NEW 
GUY MAKES THEM REALIZE JUST HOW WEIRD THEY'VE BECOME. THEN 
THEY REGRET THE SILLINESS THEY’O BEEN UP TO ALITTLE BIT. BUT... 
TIME IS A DREADFUL THING, BECAUSE BEFORE YOU KNOW IT THEY'VE 
ABSORBED THE NEW ASSISTANT ANDO RETURNED TO THEIR STATE OF 
CHAOS. 


ONE DAY, THE FOLLOWING INCIDENT TOOK PLACE: | GOT STUCK 
WRITING A MANGA JUST BEFORE THE DEADLINE, SO | LAY DOWN 
BEHINO MY DESK TO TAKE A SHORT NAP. WHEN | WAS LOOKING FOR 
SOMETHING TO USE AS A PILLOW, | FOUND A BIG FROG-SHAPED 
GAMAGUCHI CUSHION. (THIS IS A CUSHION MODELED ON THE 
FROGGIE WALLET THAT NARUTO USES IN THE SERIES. IT WAS MADE 
AS APRESENT FOR READERS.) 


2f9™~®@ 


THE CUSHION WAS JUST THE RIGHT SIZE TO LAY MY HEAD ON. THINK- 
ING |HAD MADE A GREAT DISCOVERY, | WAS GOING TO TAKE A NAP 
USING IT AS A PILLOW. ...BUT... THIS COIN PURSE-TYPE CUSHION CAN 
BE OPENED JUST LIKE A REGULAR COIN PURSE. WHILE GAZING AT IT 
IN A STUPOR, AN IDEA CROSSED MY MIND. IF IT’S BIG ENOUGH TO LAY 
MY HEAD ON, WOULDN'T IT BE POSSIBLE TO STICK MY HEAD INSIOE IT? 
THIS RATHER POINTLESS SUSPICION ENTERED MY HEAD. | SHOULD'VE 
JUST TAKEN THE NAP IMMEDIATELY; | WAS TIRED, AFTER ALL. BUT FOR 
SOME REASON, | COULON’T HELP CONFIRMING MY SUSPICION. SO | 
PUT MY HEAD IN THE COIN PURSE CUSHION AND FOUND THAT MY HEAD 
AND NECK JUST BARELY FIT INSIDE IT. 


TO THIS DAY, | HAVE NO IDEA WHY | DIO THIS. I'M CONVINCED THAT | HAD 
FALLEN VICTIM TO THE CHAOS. AT THE TIME, | HAD NO IDEA THE 
DISASTER THAT THIS WOULD LEAD TO, (TO BE CONTINUED...)

THE WORLO OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY: 
FIGHTING AGAINST CHAOS, FART 2 


WHEN | PUT MY HEAD INTO THE COIN PURSE CUSHION, | WAS 
SATISFIED TO CONFIRM THAT, JUST AS | SUSPECTED, MY HEAD 
FIT INSIDE. THEN | TRIED TO PULL MY HEAD OUT OF THE COIN 
PURSE CUSHION. ...BUT, WHEN | ACTUALLY TRIED TO PULL IT OFF, 

| COULON'T! MY EARS WERE COMPLETELY STUCK! THE INSIDE 

OF THE CUSHION WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY STUFFED WITH COTTON 
OR SOMETHING AND, AS | HURRIEOLY TRIED TO PULL MY HEAD OUT, 
THE CUSHION’S INNER SURFACE STUCK TO MY NOSE, ANDO | 
COULON’T BREATHE! “THIS COULD BE VERY BAD!” | THOUGHT 

ANDO STARTED TO GET REALLY NERVOUS. | FLOUNDEREOD AROUND, 
TRYING TO OPEN THE COIN PURSE CUSHION WITH BOTH ARMS 
AS HARD AS | COULD, 


THEN MY ASSISTANTS NOTICED ANO ASKED, ‘WHAT ARE YOU DO- 
ING, MR. KISHIMOTO?” | THOUGHT, “YES!! MY ASSISTANTS WILL 
RESCUE ME!” ANO | TRIED TO ASK THEM FORHELP. ... JUST THEN 
| HEARD SOMETHING LIKE THE SOUND OF A CAMERA SHUTTER. 

| WASN'T SURE FROM INSIDE THE CUSHION BECAUSE | COULON’T 
SEE, BUT | COULD IMAGINE WHAT WAS GOING ON. ALL OF MY 
ASSISTANTS WERE LAUGHING OUT LOUD AND TAKING PICTURES 
WITH THEIR CELL PHONE CAMERAS! OF ALL THINGS, THEY WERE 
TAKING PICTURES! THEY WEREN'T RESCUING ME; THEY WERE 
LAUGHING AND TAKING PICTURES! “NO! THEY’RE NOT TAKING THIS 
SERIOUSLY!!" | THOUGHT, AND MADE UP MY MINO THAT | HAD TO 
GET THE CUSHION OFF BY MYSELF. | PULLED HARD ANO IT HURT 
SO MUCH THAT | THOUGHT MY EARS WERE GOING TO TEAR OFF. 
THEN, FINALLY, | WAS ABLE TO FREE MYSELF, NEEDLESS TO SAY, MY 
NAP TIME WAS COMPLETELY RUINED BY THAT CRAZY INCIDENT. | 
EXPECTED THERE WOULD BE AT LEAST ONE SANE PERSON 

WHO WOULD SAY, ARE YOU OKAY, MR. KISHIMOTO?!” ...BUT THERE 
WASN'T. IT’S TRUE THAT THE ASSISTANTS HAD VERY LITTLE SLEEP 
ANO WENT A BIT NUTTY. ALL OF THEM WERE UNDER THE SPELL OF 
THE USUAL CHAOS. IT WAS THEN THAT | PLEOGED... | WILL FIGHT 
AGAINST THIS CHAOS! 


WARNING: DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME!
