Naruto has passed the 4O-volume 
mark, becoming a long-term series. 
From here on out, | plan to keep 
working hard, with my eyes trained 
on the finish line! 


—Masashi Kishitroto, 2008 





Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

THE STORY SO FAR... 


Once the bane of the Konohagakure Ninja Academy, Naruto now serves 
dutifully among the ranks of the Konoha shinobi—an illustrious group of 
ninja sworn to protect their village from the forces of evil seeking to destroy 
it from without and within... 

Naruto's search for his former classmate and friend, Sasuke—now on a 
mission of vengeance against his own brother, Itachi—finally bears fruit, and 
the paths of these two young shinobi are poised to re-converge... 

Jiraiya continues his top-secret mission within the Hidden Rain Village 
and discovers the true identity of the Akatsuki's enigmatic leader, Pain— 
who turns out to be none other than one of Jiraiya’s former disciples! 

When Pain reveals his quest to create the ultimate jutsu capable of ending all 
wars by wreaking havoc and causing rampant destruction, Jiraiya is forced to 


kill his former student in order to save the world. But as he soon discovers, 
Pain never dies...
