The Naruto comics are already 
at volume 10/ In the blink of an 
eye, we've reached double 
digits! Although | doubt that 
triple digits is a milestone we'll 
ever achieve, it would make me 
exceedingly happy if all of you 
would continue to read and 
enjoy Naruto, without ever 
getting bored, for the entire run 
of the series! 





Masashi Kishitroto, 2007 


Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

STORY AND ART BY 
MAASASHI KISHIMOTO 





SAKURA 7 7 7 
Smart and studious, Sakura

classmates, but she's 
constantly distracted by her 
crush on Sasuke. Her goal: 
to win Sasuke’s heart! 





NARUTO JUL / 


When Naruto was born, a 
destructive fox spirit was 
imprisoned inside his body. 
Spurned by the older 
villagers, he’s grown into an 
attention-seeking trouble- 
maker. His goal: to become 
the village's next Hokage. 


SASUKE *} A77 


The top student in 
Naruto's class, Sasuke 
comes from the presti- 
gious Uchiha clan. His 
goal: to get revenge on a 
mysterious person who 
wronged him in the past. 











Ss 
Rock Lee y77-1)— 
Lee has been carefully 
observing the other students. 
fights while his anticipation 

for his own battle builds. 

Now it’s about to begin! 





Gaara FQ 
Bloodthirsty Gaara is one of the 
scariest ninja competing in the 
Chinin Exams. 





a einem ) 





Might Guy 774} +7) 4 
The flamboyant Master Guy is 
Lee's idol...and Kakashiss rival! 





Orochimaru AE FL 
This nefarious master of disguise 
placed a mysterious curse-mark 
on Sasuke and hopes to mold 
Sasuke into his successor. 


Kakashi 77 < 
Although he doesn’t have an 
especially warm personality, 
Kakashi is protective of his 
students. 


THE STORY SO FARE.. 


Kabuto 77} 

A spy for Orochimaru's village 
of Otogakure (The Village 
Hidden in the Sound), Kabuto 
has been living a double life in 
Konohagakure since childhood. 


Twelve years ago, a destructive nine-tailed fox spirit attacked the ninja village of Konohagakure. The 
Hokage, or village champion, defeated the fox by sealing its soul into the body of a baby boy. Now 
that boy, Uzumaki Naruto, has grown up to become a ninja-in-training, learning the art of ninjutsu 


with his classmates Sakura and Sasuke. 


Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura (along with six other teams of student ninja) have moved on to 
the third portion of the Chunin (Journeyman Ninja) Selection Exam—a series of no-holds- 
barred, one-on-one bouts that begin with a set of preliminary matches.As the preliminaries 
continue, the battles become increasingly vicious and it’s clear that lives are on the line. After 
the fight between Hyuga Hinata and her cousin Hyuga Neji ends with Hinata being rushed to 
the emergency room, tensions are at an all-time high. Then the next two combatants are 
announced: Rock Lee and Gaara!

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, FART [2 


IN MIDOLE SCHOOL, | WAS SO FOCUSED ON BASEBALL THAT 

| ALMOST STOPPED DRAWING COMPLETELY. 

THERE WERE GAMES EVERY SATURDAY AND SUNDAY, ANO 
PRACTICE EVERY WEEKDAY MORNING. EVEN MY AFTER-SCHOOL 
TIME WAS FILLED WITH HOURS OF CRAM SCHOOL, SO | WAS 
ALWAYS INCREDIBLY BUSY. IT WAS LIKE ANOTHER WORLD 
COMFAREDO TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, AND ALL OF THE TIME | 

HAD ONCE SPENT ORAWING WAS GONE. 

ONE DAY, JUST WHEN | WAS STARTING TO THINK, "MAY6E I'VE 
OUTGROWN THE URGE TO BE ORAWING ALL THE TIME," | HAD A 
SUDDEN AND INCREDIBLE REVELATION. IT WAS SO AMAZING THAT 
| STILL LOOK BACK ON THAT MOMENT AS A HUGE TURNING POINT. 
THE AMAZING MOMENT OCCURRED WHEN | SAW A MOVIE 
POSTER. 

|WAS ON MY WAY HOME ONE DAY WHEN | HAPPENED TO GLANCE 

AT APOSTER FOR OTOMO KATSUHIRO'S AKIRA. 

IN AN INSTANT, THE SIGHT OF IT HAD AN IMFACT ON ME SO 
POWERFUL THAT EVEN NOW ITS HARD TO DESCRIBE. | STOOD 
STARING AT IT FOR OVER AN HOUR. THE POSTER FEATURED AN 
OVERHEAD SHOT OF THE MAIN CHARACTER, KANEDA, WALKING 
TOWARDS A MOTORCYCLE. THE COMPOSITION OF IT WAS 
INCREDIBLY COMPLEX. "HOW DIO THIS GUY DRAW ANYTHING SO 
COMPLICATED THAT WELL?" "I'VE NEVER KNOWN ANYONE WHO 
COULD HAVE MADE THAT COMPOSITION WORK...” 

DESPITE THE TRICKY ANGLES OF THE PERSPECTIVE, THE BIKE 
AND KANEDA WERE BOTH ORAWN PERFECTLY, WITH ALL THE SFATIAL 
RELATIONSHIPS CORRECT, THE SENSE THAT KANEDA WAS ACTUALLY 
STANDING SOLIDLY ON THE GROUND WAS CONVEYED IN A WAY THAT 
SEEMED TOTALLY REAL AND COOL. THE BIKE HAD AN AMAZING 
DESIGN, AND THERE WERE CRACKS IN THE GROUND AND PEBBLES 
SCATTERED ABOUT, SEEMINGLY AT RANDOM. THAT POSTER 
SEEMED LIKE THE COOLEST, MOST ORIGINAL THING | HAD EVER 
SEEN ANDO IT REKINOLED THE FLAME OF MY ARTISTIC FASSION. 
EVER SINCE THAT DAY, I'VE KEPT DRAWING WITH THE HOPE THAT 
SOMEDAY | CAN APPROACH THE STANDARD SET BY THAT PICTURE.

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, FART [3 


ONCE | WAS EXPOSED TO AKIRA, MY ATTITUDE TOWARD ART 
BEGAN TO CHANGE DRAMATICALLY. | OID SOME RESEARCH ON 
THE STYLE OF MR. OTOMO, THE AUTHOR AND ARTIST OF AKIRA, 
INAN ATTEMPT TO LEARN WHICH ARTISTS HAD INFLUENCED HIM... 
BUT | COULDN'T FINO ANYTHING. SO | CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS 
COMPLETELY ORIGINAL... AND THAT'S WHEN IT CAME TO ME: 
"WOW, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME SINCE SEEING MR. TORIYAMA'S 
WORK THAT I'VE BEEN SO STRONGLY AFFECTED BY SOMEONE'S 
ART." 


|HAD ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHY MR. TORIYAMA'S AND MR. 
OTOMO'S ART WERE BOTH SO FASCINATING, BUT THERE WERE 
TWO THINGS THAT | WAS SURE OF. BOTH OF THEM DID WORK THAT 
SEEMED ORIGINAL ANDO HAD A GREAT SENSE OF STYLE. | HAD THE 
FEELING THAT THEIR EFFECTS, DESIGN AND ATTENTION TO 
DETAIL WERE TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF OTHER 
PEOPLE. IN OTHER WORDS, | STARTED THINKING THAT WHAT 
"FASCINATING ART" MEANT TO ME WAS "ORIGINAL ART," ANDO THAT 
COPYCAT ART, NO MATTER HOW TECHNICALLY SKILLFUL, WAS 
MEANINGLESS. 


AFTER THAT,! TRIED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING | OREW 
WAS TRULY ORIGINAL... BUT | ALWAYS ENDED UP LETTING OUTSIDE 
INFLUENCES CREEP IN, AND MY ENO PRODUCT WASN'T ORIGINAL 
AFTERALL. STILL UNSATISFIED WITH MY RESULTS, | BEGAN 
STUDYING THE WORK OF MANY DIFFERENT MANGA ARTISTS, ONE 
BY ONE, WONDERING IF | COULD FIND ANY OTHERS WHOSE ART 
COULD RIVAL THAT OF THE TWO | ALREADY REVERED. 


THAT'S WHEN | REALIZED THAT THE ARTISTS WHOSE WORK | 
FOUND INTERESTING WERE ALL INFLUENCED EITHER BY ONE OR 
BOTH OF THE ABOVE TWO, OR BY SOMEONE ELSE, AND THAT A 
TOTALLY ORIGINAL STYLE IS VERY RARE. IN ANY CASE, | THOUGHT 
MR. OTOMO HAD THE BEST STYLE OF THEM ALL, SO | STARTED 
IMITATING HIM. IN THE BEGINNING OF EIGHTH OR NINTH GRACE, | 
BOUGHT ALL THE AKIRA-RELATED MATERIALS | COULD FIND -- THE 
ART BOOK, MANGA AND MOVIE MANGA -- AND FURIOUSLY COPIED 
THEM. BUT | CONTINUED TO STRIVE FOR MY OWN STYLE ANDO 
WORKED HARD AT ALL DIFFERENT SORTS OF ORIGINAL ART AS 
WELL. (LATER, | WOULD ENCOUNTER TWO OTHER ARTISTS WHOM 
| CAME TO CONSIDER ORIGINAL AND STYLISH, BUT THAT ISA TALE 
FOR ANOTHER DAY.)
