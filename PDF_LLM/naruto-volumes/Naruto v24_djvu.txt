(* Vol. 24 of Dragon Ball was released as 
Vol. 8 of Dragon Bal/ Z in the U.S. - Ed.) 


Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

The Sound Nin 
BOAR 





















Naruto was once the bane of the 
Konohagakure Ninja Academy. Despite the 
rough start, he and his friends Sasuke and 
Sakura successfully join the ranks of the ninja. 
But during the final tournament of the Third 
Chunin Exam, the nefarious Orochimaru 
launches Operation Destroy Konoha, during 
which the Third Hokage sacrifices his own life. 


ae | 





In the aftermath, Tsunade steps up to become 
the Fifth Hokage. Charmed by the power of 
Orochimaru, Sasuke joins up with the Sound 
Ninja Four. During a battle with the Sound Four, 
Choji and Neji both fall, but Naruto, Shikamaru 
and Kiba are still standing...

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
PERSONAL HISTORY: 
THE TOO-EMBARRASSING-TO-WRITE-ABOUT STORY, FART 3 


THE MORE | ADD TO THIS PERSONAL HISTORY, THE MORE 
MISERY | RELIVE FROM MY EMBARRASSING FAST. | ASK MYSELF 
WHETHER | ONLY OREOGE UP ALL THESE STUPID MEMORIES 
OUT OF ACOMPULSION TO FILL IN THE FAGES BETWEEN 
CHAPTERS. YET STILL | PERSIST. WELL, AT LEAST YOU CAN 
NEVER SAY | HELD BACK ON YOU AS AN ENTERTAINER, 


THE THINGS I'M ABOUT TO DISCLOSE MAY GET ALITTLE 
INTENSE FOR SOME READERS, STILL, HERE WE GO. 


THIS INCIDENT IS WEDGED IN MY BRAIN... IT WAS BACK IN 
KINDERGARTEN, THE DAY OF THE "POTATO DIGGING TOURNA- 
MENT." THAT AUTUMN, THAT DAY, IN THE MIOST OF HARVESTING 
SEASON, JUST FOR THAT EVENT, OUR SCHOOL INVITED OUR 
FAMILIES TO JOIN US. KIOS, PARENTS, TEACHERS, ALL OF US 
GOT TOGETHER TO HARVEST THE SWEET POTATOES WE'D 
PLANTED AT A NEARBY FARM. IN THE COUNTRYSIDE, YOU SEE, 
KINDERGARTENS HOLD THESE HEARTWARMING COMMUNITY 
FUNCTIONS, INTENDED TO BRING KIDS, FARENTS, ANDO 
TEACHERS CLOSER TOGETHER. 


| WAS DIGGING AWAY IN HIGH SPIRITS, TELLING MYSELF "I'LL 
FINO THE BIGGEST POTATO OF ALL, AND SURPRISE EVERY- 
BODY!" ANO THEN THERE IT WAS, A MONOLITH AMONGST 
POTATOES. IN MY DELIGHT, | STARTED DIGGING LIKE A 
STARVING MAN. MIND YOU, FOR ALL MY HASTE | WAS CAREFUL 
NOT TO BREAK THE ROOT. AND THEN THERE | WAS, CLUTCHING 
A GIANT POTATO. 


IN UNISON, EVERYBODY SCREAMED: "WOW!!" AND "THAT'S 
HUGE!" AND SO ON.| WAS IN ANOTHER WORLD. SO THEN... | 
DON'T KNOW WHY | DID THIS, BUT | STARTED RUNNING AND 
ROLLING AROUND THE FIELD, GRASPING MY PRECIOUS 
POTATO. THEN THE THOUGHT HIT ME: "| GOTTA SHOW MOM 
THIS POTATO!" SO | GLANCED AROUND FOR HER AND REAL- 
IZED SHE WASN'T THERE. SHE WAS ACTUALLY DOWN AT MY 
TWIN BROTHER'S PLOT. SEE, THE FARM WAS TERRACED, ANDO 
HIS PLOT WAS IN A FIELD BELOW. SO | PELTED STRAIGHT 
TOWARD HER, SPRINTING FROM FIELD TO FIELD, HOPPING 
DOWN THE TERRACES AND EVERYTHING. 


ANO THAT'S WHEN IT HAPPENED. | WAS IN SUCH A HURRY | 
WASN'T LOOKING, BUT IN THE LOWER FIELD, IN THE FIVE 
SQUARE METER AREA WHERE | WAS DUE TO LAND, WASA 
HEAPING PILE OF A TYPICAL RURAL ARTIFACT... 


AS YOU MAY HAVE SURMISED, IT WAS, YES, A MOUNTAIN OF 
COW MANURE!

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
PERSONAL HISTORY: 
THE TOO-EMBARRASSING-TO-WRITE-ABOUT STORY, FART 4 


THE IMAGE OF THAT SCENE IS ACID-ETCHED INTO MY MIND. | 
REMEMBER MY THOUGHTS, HOVERING THERE IN MIDAIR. WHAT 
WOULD HAPPEN IF | LOST MY BALANCE? OH NO. DON'T LET ME 
FALL DOWN. THAT'S IT, FORGET THE LEGS, IF | JUST LANO WITH 
MY UPPER BODY STRAIGHT, LIKE A GYMNAST... 


ANYWAY, NEVER MIND THE POTATO. | TOSSED IT ASIDE. 
SQUELCH. IT HIT THE MOUND FIRST. HEARING THAT SOUND 
GAVE ME THE RESOLVE | NEEDED. SQUISH SMUSSH! 
BOTH MY LEGS, PLANTED IN THE DUNG! IT WAS DEEPER THAN | 
HAD ENVISIONED. BUT ACTUALLY, THAT WAS A GODSEND. 
CEMENTED KNEE-DEEP, | MANAGED TO MAINTAIN MY BALANCE. 


INSTEAD OF SURPRISING EVERYBODY WITH MY PRIZE POTATO, | 
WOUND UP STIRRING THEM IN A DIFFERENT WAY. 


ANDO THEN CAME THE MISERY. | CALLED TO A NEARBY CLASS- 
MATE FOR HELP. HE RAN TO THE NEAREST TEACHER, 
SCREAMING FULL BLAST: "MASASHI'S BURIED IN POO!" I'LL 
NEVER FORGET WHAT HAPPENED NEXT... THE TEACHER 
REFUSED TO HELP ME. | GUESS SHE WAS AVERSE TO RURAL 
ARTIFACTS. TO MY RELIEF AND HER CREDIT, MY MOTHER THEN 
CAME TO THE RESCUE, LIFTING ME OUT OF MY PREDICAMENT 
WITHOUT HESITATION. IN THAT MOMENT | LEARNED AWE FOR 
THE LOVE OF A MOTHER. 


TO THIS DAY WHEN A YAM CROSSES MY FATH, IT BRINGS ME 
BACK TO THAT EVENT. AND NOW THE MORAL (IN TWO FARTS): 
NO GOOD EVER COMES FROM BEING CAUGHT UP WITH THINGS; 
ANDO WHEN IT COMES TO IT, MOTHERS ARE BRAVE!
