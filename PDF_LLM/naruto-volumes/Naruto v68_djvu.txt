first time in a while and planned 
to take a really short stroll in 
the winter snow with my feet 
exposed. But everything was so

—Masashi Kishimoto, 2014 








Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

THE STORY SO FAR... 


Naruto, the biggest troublemaker at the Ninja Academy in the 
Village of Konohagakure, finally becomes a ninja along with his 
classmates Sasuke and Sakura. They grow and mature through 
countless trials and battles. However, Sasuke, unable to give up his 
quest for vengeance, leaves Konohagakure to seek Orochimaru and 
his power... 

Two years pass. Naruto grows up and engages in fierce battles 
against the Tailed Beast-targeting Akatsuki.And the Fourth Great 
Ninja War against the Akatsuki finally begins. Naruto and his 
companions face off against the reunited Obito and Madara in order 
to stop the resurrected Ten Tails! But soon, Obito absorbs the Ten 
Tails and becomes a Jinchuriki. Then, in order to complete the Infinite 
Tsukuyomi, he summons forth the Divine Tree. The alliance appears 
powerless against these forces but Naruto and Sasuke stand tall. Can 
they stop Obito?!

WHAT 
ARE YOU 
TALKING 
ABOUT?! 


THERE'S NO 
NEED TO 
VOLUNTARILY 
WALK A PATH 
YOU KNOW TO 
BE RUGGED, 
WHOSE END 
POINT ISN'T 
EVEN CLEAR. 









WHAT |

WHICH ONE |S 

THE RUGGED 

ONE? 











YOU NEVER

STARTS 
WALKING. 















A HOKAGE |S 









THUS A HOKAGE 












NEVER WALKS THE FELLOW 
WHO WALKS

AHEAD OF
