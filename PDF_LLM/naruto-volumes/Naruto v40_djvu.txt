Nostalgic radio-controlled plastic 
model vehicles have recently made 
a comeback, just a bit smaller and 
easier to operate! So cool, | can't 
stand it/! The most popular models 
are, aS before, buggy types like the 
Hornet and Mighty Frog/ ...Please 
bring back my previous favorite, 
Pajero, too, Mr. Tamiya! 


—Masashi Kishimoto, 2007 





Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

THE STORY SO FAR... 


Once the bane of the Konohagakure Ninja Academy, Uzumaki Naruto now 
serves dutifully among the ranks of the Konoha shinobi—an illustrious group of 
ninja sworn to protect their village from the forces of evil seeking to destroy it 
from without and within... 

After his former classmate, Uchiha Sasuke, is seduced by the evil Orochimaru, 
Naruto makes it his personal mission to find and save his friend from the dark- 
ness growing inside him. Unfortunately, Sasuke doesn’t want to be saved. All he 
wants is revenge on the one person he hates most in the world... the person he 
blames for the murder of his parents... his older brother, Uchiha Itachi. 

Assembling his shinobi cell, The Hebi, Sasuke sets out to find and kill his 
brother. But his quest for vengeance soon brings him into conflict with Deidara 
and Tobi—members of the insidious organization known as the Akatsuki. 
Though Sasuke quickly gains the upper hand with the formidable power of his 
Sharingan, Deidara tips the scales by unveiling his latest masterpiece of 
destruction...
