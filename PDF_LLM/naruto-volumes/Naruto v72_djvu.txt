_Masashi Kishimote co: 





This is the final volume. 


Thank you so very much for your 
Support these past 15 years. 


I‘d be honored if, in the future, you 
occasionally recall that there once 
was a character named Naruto. 


Well then, please enjoy the 
conclusion of Naruto. 





—Masashi Kishimoto, 2015 


Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

THE STORY SO FAR... 

Naruto, the biggest troublemaker at the Ninja Academy in the 
Village of Konohagakure, finally becomes a ninja along with his 
classmates Sasuke and Sakura. They grow and mature through 
countless trials and battles. However, Sasuke, unable to give up his 
quest for vengeance, leaves Konohagakure to seek Orochimaru and 
his power... 

Two years pass. Naruto grows up and engages in fierce battles 
against the Tailed Beast-targeting Akatsuki.And the Fourth Great 
Ninja War against the Akatsuki finally begins. Having regained a 
living body thanks to the Rinne Rebirth jutsu, Madara activates 
the Infinite Tsukuyomi and the people are sucked into a dream 
world. Immediately afterwards, Black Zetsu betrays Madara and 
revives the Rabbit Goddess Kaguya, who attacks Naruto and the 
others! Naruto joins forces with Sasuke and succeeds in sealing 
away Kaguya, but...?!
