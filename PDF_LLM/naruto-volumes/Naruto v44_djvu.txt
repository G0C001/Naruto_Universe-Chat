| went home to visit my parents for 
the first time in a long while. The 
clouds | saw out the airplane window 
were very pleasant and made me 
remember that | like clouds. 


—Masashi Kishivroto, 2008 





Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

Naruto, the biggest troublemaker at the Ninja Academy in the Village of 
Konohagakure, finally becomes a ninja along with his classmates Sasuke and Sakura. 
They grow and mature through countless trials and battles. However, Sasuke, unable 
to give up his quest for vengeance, leaves Konohagakure to seek Orochimaru and 
his power... 

Two years pass. Naruto and his comrades grow up and head out once more.As 
their fierce battles against the Tailed Beast-targeting Akatsuki rage on, Sasuke rebels 
against Orochimaru and takes everything from him. Sasuke then gathers new 
companions and chases after Itachi. The heroic sibling battle eventually concludes 
with Itachi's grim death. Sasuke may have fulfilled his lifelong goal, but Madara then 
tells him the tragic truth about his older brother, Itachi-how he achieved revenge 
against the Uchiha clan by allowing Sasuke to defeat him and become Konaha's hero. 
After discovering Itachi's true motivations, Sasuke renames his team Taka, claiming to 
exist for one sole reason: to destroy Konoha!!
