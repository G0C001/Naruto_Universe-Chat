Naruto has been going for four 
years already. And, if | do say so 
myself, | think I've worked pretty 
hard... So | thought to myself, 
feeling pretty good about it out 
on the porch. I'll Keep giving it my 
best in year five! 


—Masashi Kishitnoto, 2003 





Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

Ss 


Twelve years ago a destructive nine-tailed fox spirit 
attacked the ninja village of Konohagakure. The Hokage, 


or village champion, defeated the fox by sealing its soul 

into the body of a baby boy. Now that boy, Uzumaki Naruto, 
has grown up to be a ninja-in-training, learning the art 

of ninjutsu with his teammates Sakura and Sasuke. 


Naruto and company take on the Chinin Selection Exams 
but suffer a sudden attack from Orochimaru in the Forest 
of Death. Orochimaru leaves a curse mark on Sasuke’s body 
and vanishes, only to return during the final round to launch 
Operation Destroy Konoha! While Naruto battles Gaara, 
the Third Hokage falls to Orochimaru. 


Jiraiya, taking Naruto along for training, sets out on a 
journey to find the Fifth Hokage, Tsunade. Meanwhile, 
Orochimaru makes Tsunade a proposition: in exchange for 
healing his arms, he would revive her deceased loved ones. 
As Tsunade struggles to decide, Jiraiya and Naruto arrive on 
the scene. What will Tsunade choose...?!

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, FART 30: NO. I 


THIS TIME MY STORY IS ABOUT MY DARK AND DEPRESSING 
YOUNGER DAYS... I WAS A FOURTH YEAR COLLEGE STUDENT 
AND GRADUATION WAS RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER. 

STILL, IHAD MADE NO PROGRESS AT ALL TOWARD 
BECOMING A MANGA ARTIST. I FELT DOWN ALL THE TIME... 
THAD BEEN DRAWING THINGS LIKE BOYS’ ACTION AND STUFF, 
BUT NO MATTER WHAT I OREW IT ALWAYS CAME OUT LOOKING 
DULL ANO TYPICAL. EVERYTHING WAS TOTALLY, UNIFORMLY 
REJECTED, LOOKING BACK ON THOSE DAYS NOW, I'D SAY 
THAT THEY WERE PROBABLY THE MOST DIFFICULT OF MY LIFE. 
CHANGING YOURSELF EVEN ALITTLE REQUIRES MUCH MORE 
EFFORT THAN YOU THINK... TRANSFORMING MYSELF FROM 

A YOUNG MAN WHO JUST ADORED MANGA INTO A 
PROFESSIONAL MANGA ARTIST... THAT WAS A MASSIVE 
CHANGE FOR ME AND IT REQUIRED AN ENORMOUS 

AMOUNT OF ENERGY. 


HAVING DREAMT ABOUT BECOMING A MANGA ARTIST, I FELT 
ALITTLE TRIUMPHANT AFTER RECEIVING A MANGA AWARD, 

I FELT AS THOUGH I HAD COME CLOSER TO BECOMING APRO. 
THAD NO INTENTION OF SHOWING OFF MY AWARD, ANO I 
DON’T THINK THAT I DID. HOWEVER, DEEP DOWN I WAS 
THINKING, ‘WELL, I CAN RELAX A BIT NOW. AFTER ALL, I'VE 

WON AN AWARD.” 


BUT EVEN NOW I SOMETIMES THINK THAT WAS THE BIGGEST 
MISTAKE OF My LIFE. LIKE I SAID, CHANGING ONESELF TAKES 
ALOT OF ENERGY. BUT MY RECEIVING THAT AWARD DION’T 
MEAN THAT I HAD CHANGED THROUGH MY OWN EFFORTS; 

IT WAS JUST AN ILLUSION THAT MADE IT LOOK THAT WAY. 

AT OUR FIRST MEETING, MY EOITOR MR. YAHAGI GAVE ME A 
WORD OF ADVICE: “IT’S AFTER YOU WIN AN AWARD THAT THE 
HARD FART COMEG....” OVER TIME I CAME TO UNDERSTAND 
WHAT HE MEANT. 


I THINK NOW THAT WINNING AWARDS OR NOT DOESN'T 
REALLY MATTER VERY MUCH. WINNING AN AWARD DOESN'T 
MAKE YOU A PRO. YOU'RE ONLY A STEP UP FROM BEING JUST 
A MANGA LOVER. A TRUE PRO |S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT THING. 
IKNOW THAT NOW. BUT THAT ISA TRAP THAT PEOPLE WHO 
HAVE JUST BEGUN THEIR CAREERS AS MANGA ARTISTS 
TEND TO GET CAUGHT IN. I'M NO EXCEPTION, ANO IT TOOK 
ME A TREMENCOUS AMOUNT OF TIME ANDO EFFORT TO GET 
OUT OF THAT TRAP... BUT THAT'S A STORY I'LL CONTINUE 
ANOTHER TIME... BOY... THAT’S A DISMAL STORY...

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, FART 30: NO. 2 


IN THE PREVIOUS STORY, I SAID THAT I WAS CAUGHT IN A TRAP. 
THIS TRAP WAS A STRONG ONE AND SO ONCE TRAPPED, 
I COULON’T ESCAPE FROM IT EASILY. 


AFTER WINNING AN AWARD, MY THOUGHTS WERE: “BECOMING 
APROFESSIONAL WON'T BE FAR OFF NOW THAT I'VE WON 

AN AWARD WITH MY WORK. I'LL JUST REARRANGE MY AWARD- 
WINNING MANGA ‘KARAKURI’ AND CREATE ANOTHER STORY.” 

IN THIS LIGHTHEARTED STATE OF MIND, I CONTINUED WRITING 
ANOTHER MANGA. BUT, AS I SHOULD HAVE EXPECTED, MY WORK 
WAS CONSISTENTLY TURNED DOWN. I SPENT A YEAR MUCKING 
AROUND WITH THE STORY, SETTING AND CHARACTERS IN VAIN. 
AROUND THIS TIME, I BEGAN TO DOUBT MY TALENT ANC ABILITY 
ANO BEGAN TO THINK THAT I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO BECOME 
A MANGA ARTIST AFTERALL. 


MEANWHILE, MOST OF MY FRIENDS STARTED JOB-HUNTING 
ANO GETTING JOBS. I, ON THE OTHER HAND, WAS CETERMINED 
TO BECOME A MANGA ARTIST AFTER GRADUATING, AND DION’T 
00 ANYTHING ABOUT GETTING OTHER JOBS AT ALL. SURE 
ENOUGH, I WAS ALITTLE SCARED... AFTER ALL, THIS WASA 
PERIOD WHEN I COUBTEO WHETHER I COULD EVEN BECOME A 
MANGA ARTIST. BUT CREATING AN ESCAPE ROUTE WOULD HAVE 
MEANT ACKNOWLEDGING TO MYSELF THAT I COULD NEVER DO 
IT. 


TWAS IMPATIENT ANDO WENT ROUND AND ROUNO IN CIRCLES 
AND GOT NOWHERE. I CREATED DRAFTS DESPERATELY 
WANTING TO FEEL LIKE APRO. ALL REJECTS. 


IN THE END, I WOUNO UP GRADUATING FROM COLLEGE HAVING 
ACCOMPLISHED NOTHING. 


MY FARENTS HAD SPENT ALOT OF MONEY SENDING ME TO 
COLLEGE ANO I OWED THEM ALOT, AND NOT JUST FOR THAT. 
YET I DIO NOTHING TO GET ANY OTHER JOB AND JUST KEPT 
TELLING MY PARENTS THAT I WOULD BECOME A MANGA ARTIST 
AS THOUGH I WERE IN A DREAM... WY FARENTS WERE STRICT IN 
RAISING ME AND SO IWAS PREPARED FOR A SCOLDING. ON 
THE CONTRARY, HOWEVER, THEY SUPPORTED MY UNREALISTIC. 
OREAMS. ONE DAY MY FARENTS AND MY YOUNGER BROTHER 
WERE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO MAKE MONEY FOR HIS COLLEGE 
TUITION. MY BROTHER SAID TO ME “WE COULD HAVE BOUGHT A 
FERRARI WITH THE MONEY SPENT ON YOUR EDUCATION!” THEN 
I REALIZED HOW MUCH MONEY IT HAD COST THEM SENDING 
ME TO COLLEGE... WHEN I RECALLED WY COLLEGE DAYS 
ALWAYS PLAYING MAHJONG WITH MY FRIENDS, I REALIZED HOW 
STUPID IHAO BEEN AND FELT ANGRY WITH MYSELF. AROUND 
THIS TIME, MY FATHER STOPPED BY TO TALK OVER HIS IDEAS 
OF A NEW MANGA STORY ANDO CHARACTERS. WHILE LISTENING 
TO HIS MOSTLY UNINTERESTING IDEAS, I REALIZED THAT I HAO 
TO BECOME A MANGA ARTIST SOON AND PUT MY FARENTS AT 
EASE. THINGS COULDN'T STAY THE WAY THEY WERE. 

TO BE CONTINUED... IT'S SOOOO DEPRESSING...

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, FART 30: NO.3 


BECOMING A MANGA ARTIST IS NOT SOMETHING ONE DOES TO SATISFY 
THEIR PARENTS OR FOR MONEY. BUT ASLONG AS ONE AIMS TO BE A 
MANGA ARTIST, VARIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES ARE BOUND TO ARISE ALONG 
THE WAY. IN THE END, MAKING THESE THINGS GO SMOOTHLY WAS SOME- 
THING | DID FOR MYSELF... IN OTHER WORDS, IT WAS A FART OF MY 
BECOMING A MANGA ARTIST. 


TO THAT END, I REALIZED THAT MY LIFE COULDN'T CONTINUE GOING 
THE WAY IT HAD BEEN. 


I DECIDED TO GO BACK TO BASICS AND THOROUGHLY RESTUDY MANGA 
FROM THE BEGINNING. 


FIRST, I BEGAN WITH THE FOLLOWING QUESTION: WHAT IS A STORY? 
THEN I LOOKED UP THE MEANINGS OF ALL MANGA-RELATED TERMS, 
ASKING MYSELF: WHAT DOES THEME REALLY MEAN? WHAT DO EPISODE, 
STRUCTURE, CHARACTERS AND DIRECTION MEAN? I STUDIED THEM 
ANO TRIEO TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THOSE WOROS MEANT AND HOW TO 
USE THEM. 


WHAT I ACTUALLY DID WAS VISIT LIBRARIES AND STUDY THE THINGS 
NECESSARY TO CREATE A STORY, SUCH AS HOW TO WRITE A STORY, 
MAKING SCENARIO SYNOPSES, MISLEADING, HOOK TECHNIQUES, CATCH, 
THREE-ACT STRUCTURE, SET-UP ORDER, HOW TO CREATE AND DISPLAY 
CHARACTERS, THEIR ROLES, STORY PATTERNS, AND SO ON... THESE 
THINGS I LEARNED BY READING HOW-TO BOOKS ON SCRIPTWRITING 
ANDO BECOMING AWRITER. 


IT ACTUALLY WATCHED THE MOVIES USED AS EXAMPLES IN THOSE 
BOOKS TO LEARN DIRECTING TECHNIQUES, CHARACTER DEVELOP- 
MENT ANO STORY STRUCTURE, I ALSO READ SUSPENSE NOVELS TO 
STUDY METHODS OF LEADING AND HOLDING, TECHNIQUES OF DELIBER- 
ATELY NOT USING NOUNS, AND MISLEADING TECHNIQUES NECESSARY 
TO MAKE THE STORY ENTERTAINING, IN SHORT, I LEARNEO HOW TO 
WRITE A STORY BY READING BOOKS. 


..BUT I COULON’T ACQUIRE THESE TECHNIQUES JUST BY READING. 

SO IWATCHED LOTS OF MCVIES TO FINO HOW, AND IN WHICH SCENES, 
THE TECHNIQUES INTRODUCED IN THOSE BOOKS WERE ACTUALLY 
USED AND IWROTE THEM DOWN IN NOTEBOOKS AND STOCKPILED 
THEM. THEN I SET ABOUT DEVELOPING THIS MATERIAL AND THUS MADE 
THE TECHNIQUES MY OWN. 


I WROTE OUT EACH LINE OF PULP FICTION TO STUDY CHARACTERS AND 
STORY STRUCTURE. I READ NOVELS WRITTEN BY DAZAI OSAMU TO 
LEARN HOW TO TREAT THEME, AND DISCOVERED SOME FATTERNS. I 
SUNK MY TEETH INTO WHATEVER I THOUGHT OF AS ENTERTAINMENT 
AND SEARCHED FOR ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS, ‘WHAT'S INTEREST- 
ING?” AND “HOW IS IT INTERESTING?” I WOKE UP IN THE MORNING AND 
VISITED LIBRARIES, BOOKSTORES AND VIDEO STORES... I SPENT EVERY 
OAY LIKE THAT FOR TWO YEARS AFTER GRADUATING COLLEGE. 


I DION’T MAKE MANY STORYBOARDS DURING THAT TIME. BUT IT 
APPEARED THAT MY FIRST VERSION OF NARUTO, AONE-SHOT MANGA IT 
WROTE SOON AFTER STARTING THIS RESEARCH, SOMEHOW GAINED 
POPULARITY IN AKAMARU JUMP, ROUGH WORK THOUGH IT WAS. 


TO BE CONTINUED, SEE, THE STORY’S GETTING BRIGHTER, RIGHT?

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, FART 30: NO.F 


OURING THE TWO LONG AND BITTER YEARS AFTER COLLEGE, 
WHICH WERE STILL ENJOYABLE BECAUSE I COULD FEEL 
MYSELF IMPROVING, I ORGANIZED MY OWN METHOD OF 
MANGA WRITING IN A NOTEBOOK. THIS IS THE TOP SECRET 
KISHIMOTO MASASHI NOTEBOOK. IT’S A MASTER PLAN 

I CAN'T SHOW ANYBODY! 


IN THESE TWO YEARS, I GAINED A LOT OF CONFIDENCE. 

SO, WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY I SET ABOUT WRITING MANGA 
USING MY CONFIDENTIAL NOTEBOOK. MY THEME WAS BASE- 
BALL! AND THE TITLE WAS YAKYL/-OH, BASEBALL KING! 


AFTER A SHORT TIME, I FINISHEO THE SCRIPT AND SHOWED 
IT TO MY EDITOR, MR. YAHAGI. “IT'S INTERESTING, BUT...I THINK 
IT’S A BIT DARK,” HE SAID. “BUT I DION’T KNOW YOU COULD 
WRITE THIS STYLE OF MANGA... YOU'VE IMPROVED,” I WAS 
CELIGHTED TO HEAR THOSE WORDS. ALTHOUGH YAKYL-OH 
PASSED MR. YAHAGI'S CHECK, A HIGHER COMMITTEE 
DECIDED THAT THE CONTENT WAS TOO SERIOUS FORA 
BOYS’ MAGAZINE... IN SHORT, IT WAS TURNED DOWN. 


STILL, YAKYL-OH WAS MY TURNING POINT. THOUGH IT WAS NOT 
PUBLISHED, MR. YAHAGI SAID, “INTERESTING! THIS MANGA IS 
OEFINITELY INTERESTING! IT WOULD'VE BEEN TOTALLY FINE 
FOR A YOUNG ADULT MAGAZINE...” THIS MANGA WAS THE FIRST 
WORK OF MINE TO RECEIVE SUBSTANTIAL PRAISE FROM 

MR. YAHAGI. I FELT MY TWO YEARS OF WORK HAO SURE FAID OFF. 


FOUR MONTHS LATER, IWROTE A MANGA SCRIPT FOR 
ANOTHER BOYS’ MAGAZINE ANO SHOWED IT TO MR. YAHAGI. 
MR. YAHAGI SAID, “IT'S PERFECT! SOME MINOR FARTS WILL 
HAVE TO BE REVISED, THOUGH!” IN THOSE TWO YEARS, 
TWAS ABLE TO CHANGE MYSELF A LITTLE BIT. WHAT'S MORE, 
I MANAGED TO START A SERIES WITH THAT STORYBOARD,
