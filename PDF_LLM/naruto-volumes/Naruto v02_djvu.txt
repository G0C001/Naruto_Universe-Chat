Story & Art by 


Masashi Kishimoto wating 








One day | got a phone call from a 
relative of mine and got seriously 
chewed out. WhyP The reason was 
the art | drew of myself in volume 
one. My aunt saw the picture of me 
eating ramen, and said “Is he only 
eating ramen again?’ Every time you 
came over to my house, you 
demanded instant noodles instead of 
the home-cooked meal | had ready 
for you! You'd better be getting your vegetables!” Don't 
worry, auntie—| av77 eating my vegetables. (P.S. They 
just came out with instant noodles in “Cheese Curry 
Flavor.” It's really tasty.) 

—Masashi Kishittoto, 2000 














Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in |974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (“mechanism”). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

THE MAKING OF NARUTO: 
KONOHAMARU & EBISU 


These were my first sketches of Konohamaru and his teacher, Ebisu 
(see Naruto Vol. |). | remember really struggling with 
Konohamaru’s design. He was supposed to be a little punk, smaller 
than Naruto, but he kept coming out looking like Naruto no matter 
what | tried. | tried drawing a big-eyed kid, but this didn’t work 
either. It always turned out like a face I’d seen somewhere before. 
Eventually, | drew an angry-looking face with small eyes, and some- 
how | knew I’d found it! 


At that point | decided that Ebisu would look like the sketch above. 
| like Ebisu’s design because he’s like me, somehow...

IRUKA & MIZUKI 


These were my first sketches of Iruka and Mizuki (see Naruto 
Vol. |). In the final version, Mizuki’s bangs are parted in the center, 
but otherwise he’s pretty much the same. lruka used to have a 
more evil look around his eyes, and sharper cheekbones, but | 
made him more relaxed and younger-looking. 


One more thing. When | was originally planning who Iruka and 
Mizuki’s teacher was going to be, | decided on the next teacher’s 
name at the same time. If you look in the bottom right corner, you 
can see some of the names | considered: Kakashi (“scarecrow”), 
Kuwa (“hoe”), Kama (“scythe”), Botan (“peony” or “button”) and 
Enoki (a Chinese nettle tree). Looking back at it, though, I’m really 
glad | used “Kakashi.”

MAKE-OUT PARADISE 


I’ve gotten a number of letters asking me to tell more about 
Make-Out Paradise, the books Kakashi is always reading. 
Therefore, I’ve decided to write a little bit about it. 





Make-Out Paradise (a three-volume series) is Kakashi’s 
favorite reading material! The plot involves 


cantiad Umm...unfortunately, even though Naruto is “recom- 
mended for ages 13 and up,’ it’s not quite “adult” enough to 
explain the story of Make-Out Paradise. Sorry! But | will 
say that if Kakashi gets his wish, Make-Out Paradise Vol. | 


may yet be published in English!
