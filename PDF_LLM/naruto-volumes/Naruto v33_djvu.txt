There is one period during each day 
that is my favorite time... The hour 
between 10 and 11 in the morning. 
The reason is that everything always 
seems so refreshing and delightful at 
that hour. But because of looming 
deadlines, | usually end up sleeping 
through it...That refreshing and 
delightful feeling...what was it like 
again? 


—Masashi Kishitmoto, 2006 





Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

CHARACTERS 















Against all odds, Uzumaki Naruto, the student least likely 
to graduate from the Ninja Academy in the village of Konoha- 
gakure, becomes a ninja along with his classmates and closest 
friends, Sasuke and Sakura. During the Chdnin Selection 
Exams, however, the turncoat ninja Orochimaru launches 
Operation Destroy Konoha, forcing Naruto’s mentor, the 
Third Hokage, to sacrifice his own life to stop the attack and 
save the village. 


| 





Further tragedy follows when Sasuke succumbs to the lure 
of Orochimaru’s power. Though Naruto fights valiantly to 
stop Sasuke from joining up with their worst enemy, he 
ultimately fails. After Sasuke flees with Orochimaru, Naruto 
vows to rescue his friend someday... 















In the interim, two years pass and Naruto and his com- 
rades once again confront the mysterious Akatsuki organiza- 
tion. But intelligence gained during that battle leads the new 
Team Kakashi to a secret rendezvous with an Akatsuki spy 
who turns out to be none other than the ever-duplicitous 
Kabuto! Unbeknownst to our heroes, the whole event takes 
place under the watchful snake eyes of Orochimaru...!
