Ever since | wrote in the author's note 
of the previous book, volume 47, “The 
finale having been settled, | am 

drawing full steam ahead," lots of folks 
have been asking me, “Is the series 
ending soon?” but it is simply that the 
premise has been set; it will Keep going 
for a long, long time! | shall not stop 
drawing at full steam, so please 
continue enjoying Naruto until the end/ 





—Masashi Kishitroto, 2O09 


Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

THE STORY SO FAR... 


Naruto, the biggest troublemaker at the Ninja Academy in the Village 
of Konohagakure, finally becomes a ninja along with his classmates 
Sasuke and Sakura. They grow and mature through countless trials and 
battles. However, Sasuke, unable to give up his quest for vengeance, 
leaves Konohagakure to seek Orochimaru and his power... 

Two years pass. Naruto grows up and engages in fierce battles 
against the Tailed Beast-targeting Akatsuki. Elsewhere, after winning 
the heroic battle against Itachi and learning his older brother's true 
intentions, Sasuke allies with Akatsuki and sets out to destroy Konoha! 

During his battle against Pain, Naruto releases the Nine Tails’ power... 
But when Naruto has a conversation with the Fourth Hokage, he 
regains control over himself and heads toward Pain’s mastermind to 
end it all!!
