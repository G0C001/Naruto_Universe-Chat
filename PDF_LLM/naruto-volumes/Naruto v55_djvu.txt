I'm always in a quandary over 
who to draw on the cover of 
each graphic novel volume... 

but | usually choose characters 
that were very prominent in the 
Storylines within that volume. But 
lately they've all been unsightly 
old fogeys/! 





—Masashi Kishimoto, 2077 


Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

Naruto continues training, still sequestered from the battlefield, while the 
Allied Forces fight harsh battles against the heroes Kabuto has resurrected. 
And do additional enemies threaten the main regiment of the Allied Forces?!
