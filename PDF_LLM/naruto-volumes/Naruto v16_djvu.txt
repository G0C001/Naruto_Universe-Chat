Story & Art by 


Masashi Kishimoto welams 


Recently, in movies... What?! 

Film commentary again?! ...But it's 
pretty much the only thing | can write 
about... Sorry. So, back to the 
story... These days, there are usually 
three performers per character or 
role. The first is the billed actor (the 
star). The second is the stunt man. 
And then there is the CGI stunt man 
for particularly dangerous scenes or 
difficult camera shots. They're very 
well constructed. At this rate, we 
may even eventually stop needing real 
actors... 





—Masashi Kishimoto, 2003 


Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in |997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

) wy 








Twelve years ago a destructive nine-tailed fox spirit 
attacked the ninja village of Konohagakure. The 
Hokage, or village champion, defeated the fox by 
sealing its soul into the body of a baby boy. Now that 
boy, Uzumaki Naruto, has grown up to be a ninja-in- 
training, learning the art of ninjutsu with his team- 
mates Sakura and Sasuke. 


Naruto and company take on the Chunin Selection 
Exams but suffer a sudden attack from Orochimaru 
in the Forest of Death. Orochimaru leaves a curse 
mark on Sasuke’s body and vanishes... 


During the finals of the Chdnin Exams, Orochimaru, 
disguised as Kazekage, takes the Hokage hostage and 
erects a barrier shield. Operation Destroy Konoha is 
underway! Meanwhile, Naruto and his friends have 
been chasing after Sasuke and Gaara, who is under- 
going a terrifying transformation. Now, to save Sasuke 
and Sakura, Naruto must face off against this mon- 
strous new version of Gaara.

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, PART 23 


IN MY SECOND YEAR OF COLLEGE, | GOT SERIOUS AND DECIDED 
TO SUBMIT MANGA FOR REAL, TARGETING SHONEN MAGAZINES. 
“NOW! WHAT SHALL | DRAW...” | STARTED OFF IN HIGH SPIRITS, BUT 
THEN IMMEDIATELY RAN INTO A BLOCK, THE STORY | HAD THOUGHT 
UP HAD TOO MANY PLOT POINTS, AND | COULDN'T FIT EVERYTHING 
INTO THE PAGE LIMIT. EARLY ON IN ONE’S CAREER, ONE OFTEN BE- 
COMES OVERENTHUSIASTIC AND GREEDY, TRYING TO SQUEEZE 
ALL OF ONE’S IDEAS INTO A SINGLE PIECE. | WAS LIKE THAT TOO. 
THE STORY OFTEN BECOMES CLUNKY AND UNWIELDY, AND THERE 
ARE SO MANY CHARACTERS THAT NO ONE CHARACTER ENDS UP 
STANDING OUT AS THE MAIN CHARACTER. 


THUS! | USED THE PAGE LIMIT AS MY CLEAR-CUT SOLUTION. | 
SHAVED OFF WHATEVER PLOT POINTS | FELT WERE EXTRANEOUS, 
AND GOT RID OF A BUNCH OF CHARACTERS. WHEN | FINALLY FELT | 
COULD TELL THE STORY WITHIN THE PAGE LIMIT, | SAT DOWN AND 
STARTED DRAWING IN EARNEST. ... HOWEVER, IT’S NOT LIKE THE 
STORY COULD STAY COMPLETELY THE SAME, SO A FEW MINOR 
OIFFICULTIES AROSE. ...BUT... THEY WEREN'T HUGE DIFFICULTIES! 
JUST THAT PLOT-WISE, | HAD ORIGINALLY WANTED TO TELL THE 
TALE OF A NATIONAL DILEMMA STARRING A MAIN CHARACTER 
POSSESSING NATIONAL POWER, WITH GRAND SPECTACLE (!). BUT 
IN THE END, IT WAS A SMALL-SCALE STORY INVOLVING “SMALL- 
TOWN FOLK" THAT | SOMEHOW MANAGED TO WORK UP... IT’S LIKE 
THE FEW MINOR DIFFICULTIES THAT WOULD CROP UP IF ONE 
FORGED AHEAD AND FILMED A SCI-FI MOVIE EVEN KNOWING ONE 
WOULON'T BE GIVEN ANYTHING NEAR AN ADEQUATE BUDGET. 
THAT'S WHAT’S KNOWN AS A NEWCOMER’S COARSENESS SHOW- 
ING THROUGH HIS INABILITY TO SNUGLY CONTAIN THINGS"! 


wlN ANY CASE! WHAT | AIMED FOR WAS WEEKLY SHONEN JUMF'S 
HOP YSTEP AWARD, WITH ITS PRIZE MONEY OF 500 THOUSAND YEN 
(ROUGHLY 55000) (TAKE-HOME)... OR RATHER... | WON!!! 


THE TITLE OF THAT MANGA WAS “KARAKURI” (MECHANISM). “KARA- 
KURI” IS A POPULAR NAME FOR A SUPER-STRENGTH ANDROID OR 
ROBOT. | HAD ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT JAPANESE NAMING SCHEMES 
WERE COOL, SO | DECIDED | WOULDN'T USE ANY WEIRD WESTERN 
TERMS OR NAMES. THAT'S WHY | WENT WITH THE JAPANESE “KARA- 
KURI” INSTEAD OF "CYBORG"! AND IT TURNS OUT THAT THIS STAND- 
ALONE STORY, “KARAKURI,” WOULD GREATLY CHANGE MY DESTINY. 
BUT OF THAT, THE YOUNG KISHIMOTO WAS STILL UNAWARE.

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, PART 24 CHAPTER | 


| SOMEHOW MANAGED TO FINISH DRAWING THE 3! PAGES OF 
THE STAND-ALONE “KARAKURI”, ANO THE DAY | HAO TO MAIL IT IN 
TO JUMP FINALLY ARRIVED. IF | REMEMBER CORRECTLY, IT WAS 
RIGHT AT THE ENO OF FEBRUARY, AND MY EXAMINER WAS 
ARAK! HIROHIKO* SENSEI. 


| WENT TO THE POST OFFICE, NERVOUSLY HANDED OVER MY 
MANUSCRIPT, AND PUT MY HANOS TOGETHER SAYING “PLEASE 
LET ME WIN!” | WAS PRAYING TO THE GODS ONLY WHEN CONVE- 
NIENT, AS USUAL. BUT ALWAYS WITH UTMOST SINCERITY, OF 
COURSE! | WOULD CLOSE MY EYES ANDO WISH FERVENTLY 
FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART. | PROBABLY REPEATED MY 
WORDS, OFFERING THEM TO THE HEAVENS, 20 TIMES. | WAS 
PRAYING SO EARNESTLY THAT | DION’T NOTICE AT FIRST, BUT 
WHEN | CAME TO, THE POSTAL WORKER WAS FROZEN IN PLACE, 
ENVELOPE IN HAND, WITH AN INCREDIBLY COLD LOOK IN HIS 
EYES. 


NOT THAT | BLAME HIM, FOR IF SOMEONE HANOS YOU AN 
ENVELOPE AND IMMEDIATELY FALLS INTO FERVENT WORSHIP, 
ANYONE WOULD THINK “THIS FELLOW’'S WEIRD...”. FURTHER- 
MORE, | HAD STARTED MUTTERING UNDER MY BREATH, 
LOOKING ALL SERIOUS, SO FORGET WEIRD, HE PROBABLY 
THOUGHT | WAS SCARY! BUT | DIDN'T CARE!! | WANTED TO WIN 
THE AWARD SO BAD, | COULON'T HELP IT!! 


AFTERWARDS, | HAD TO GO HOME AND WAIT THE LONG TWO 
MONTHS UNTIL THE WINNERS WERE ANNOUNCED. ...EVEN 
OURING FUN CONVERSATIONS WITH FRIENDS, OR IN THE 
MIOOLE OF CLASS, | COULDN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT IT. IT 
WOULD KEEP ME UP AT NIGHT IF | THOUGHT ABOUT IT RIGHT 
BEFORE BEDTIME. | WOULD SECRETLY PEEK BACK AT THE 
COPY OF MY MANUSCRIPT AND BE LIKE, “SHOOT! THIS WILL 
NEVER WIN!” OR, “HMM~! BUT MAYBE, JUST MAYBE, IT WILL 
PASS...” ...| BECAME MENTALLY FATIGUED. AND SIX DAYS BEFORE 
THE RESULTS WERE SUPPOSED TO BE ANNOUNCED, ONE OF 
MY FRIENOS TOLD ME SOMETHING OUTRAGEOUS! 


THAT FRIEND WAS A HIGH SCHOOL FRIEND OF USUTA KYOSUKE* 
SENSEI. AND THIS 1S WHAT HE TOLD ME. 


(TO BE CONTINUED) 
(NOTE: ARAKI HIROHIKO IS THE ARTIST OF JOJO'S BIZARRE 


AOQVENTURE. USUTA KYOSUKE IS THE ARTIST OF SEXY COM-

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, PART 24 CHAPTER 2 


MY FRIEND TOLD ME, “USUTA SENSEI WAS CONTACTED BY THE 
EDITORIAL DEPARTMENT ABOUT ONE WEEK AGO”! 


“WHAT!” MEANS WHAT? ANDO WHAT DOES IT MEAN THAT | 
HAVEN'T BEEN CONTACTED YET, THEN!? DON’T TELL ME | 
DION’T MAKE IT?!! | FELT OEFLATED, TOOK OFF FROM 
SCHOOL, GOT SULKY, AND PLAYED VIDEO GAMES. HOWEVER, 
WHILE | WAS PLAYING VIDEO GAMES, IN THE BOTTOM OF MY 
HEART... BUT IF WHOEVER WON IS CONTACTED TOO EARLY 
AND OUT OF BLIND ECSTASY POSTS HIS VICTORY ON THE 
INTERNET, EVERYONE WILL KNOW THE RESULT BEFORE IT’S 
ANNOUNCED IN JUMP! IF THAT WERE TO HAPPEN, THAT 
WOULD BE BAD! IT’S JUST NOT KOSHER! THAT’S PROBABLY 
WHY THEY DON’T CONTACT YOU UNTIL THAT DAY OR AT THE 
EARLIEST THE DAY BEFORE JUMP HITS THE BOOKSTORES! 
SURELY! | KEPT SILENTLY MAKING SUCH EXCUSES TO MYSELF 
AND PRAYED THAT | WOULD HEAR FROM THEM. 


AND THEN, IT WAS FINALLY THE DAY BEFORE THE ANNOUNCE- 
MENT! | ENDED UP STAYING HOME THE WHOLE DAY, THINKING 
THAT | MIGHT GET A CALL, BUT THE DAY ENDED WITHOUT ANY 
WORD, THAT NIGHT, | HAD TROUBLE FALLING ASLEEP, STAYING 
UP UNTIL MIDNIGHT ALL ANXIOUS. ANO THEN, JUST AS 1 
STARTED FEELING MYSELF NOD OFF... THE PHONE RANG... 


| PICKED THE RECEIVER UP AND PUT IT TO MY EAR. MY HEART 
FELT LIKE IT WAS GOING TO BURST! “HELLO... THIS IS 
KISHIMOTO.” THEN... “HELLO, THIS IS WEEKLY SHONEN JUMP 
CALLING...” “.. YES?!" | IMMEDIATELY BLURTED... “WE WOULD 
LIKE TO INFORM YOU THAT YOUR “KARAKURI” HAS BEEN 
SELECTED AS THIS ROUND’S WINNER! CONGRATULATIONS!” 
WHEN | HEARD THAT, | SERIOUSLY THOUGHT MY HEART HAD 
BURST, IT POUNDED! SO HARD, AND THEN | WOKE UP... 


IT HAD ALL BEEN A OREAM. I'M DEAD SERIOUS!! | WAS SO 
BLUE ONCE | WAS COMPLETELY AWAKE! 


ANDO THEN, FINALLY, ON THE ACTUAL MORNING OF THE 
ANNOUNCEMENT DAy, “I WISH THAT OREAM WAS A PORTENT”... 
| THOUGHT TO MYSELF, AS | HEADED TO THE CONVENIENCE 
STORE. | HAD ALREADY RESIGNED MYSELF TO THE WORST. 

| MAY NOT HAVE MADE IT... | WANTED TO JUST KNOW THE 
RESULT AND GET IT OVER WITH AND YET | DION’T... WITH THAT 
CONFLICTED FEELING, | ENTERED THE CONVENIENCE 
STORE, WHERE A MOUNTAINOUS PILE OF WEEKLY SHONEN 
JUMP LAY STACKED RIGHT NEXT TO THE REGISTER. | DON’T 
THINK MY HEART EVER POUNDED THAT HARD. | FELT LIKE IT 
WAS GOING TO JUMP OUT OF MY THROAT.

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, PART 24 CHAPTER 3 


SO | IMMEDIATELY WENT TO BUY THE ISSUE OF JUMP, BUT MY 
HANDS WERE TREMBLING SO MUCH | COULDN'T HOLD ON TO IT 
VERY WELL, MY HEART WASN'T JUST POUNDING, IT WAS BOUND- 
ING. | SOMEHOW MANAGED TO PAY FOR THE JUMP, AND | LOOKED 
FOR THE ANNOUNCEMENTS FAGE RIGHT AWAY. | SWEAR | ALMOST 
COLLAPSED! 


WHICH 1S IT?! DIO | WIN?! OIO.| NOT WIN?! WHICH IS IT, DARN IT?! 
WITH SUCH IRRATIONAL TENSION, | EAGERLY FLIPPED THOUGH 
THE FAGES! (| BET | DION’T GET IT, DARN IT!!) ANO SO, | FINALLY 
REACHED THE PAGE BEFORE THE ANNOUNCEMENT PAGE FOR 
THE FEBRUARY HOP 3 STEP AWARD, AND | SLOWLY TURNED THE 
PAGE. 


THIS ART LOOKS KIND OF FAMILIAR... 


THAT WAS MY FIRST IMPRESSION. ... THEN, IT STARTED SINKING IN... 


.. THESE DRAWINGS... THEY'RE MY DRAW- 
INGS... THEY'RE MY DRAWINGS! ...WHICH 
MEANS... 


AND THEN, OBLIVIOUS TO ALL THE FOLK WHO WERE IN THAT 
CONVENIENCE STORE, | SUDDENLY CRIED OUT: 


“WHOA, WHOA" 


| SO COULON’T SPEAK CLEARLY | MUST HAVE SEEMED LIKE A 
DERANGED LUNATIC WHO WAS CHANTING SOME WEIRD SPELL 
.~PROBABLY. AND THEN, | STARTED QUIVERING. | WAS SO ECSTATIC 
| THOUGHT | WAS GOING TO EXPLODE, ANO | EXITEO THE STORE. 
..SUDBDDENLY, FOR NO EXPLAINABLE REASON, | VIOLENTLY THREW 
THE JUMP ACROSS THE ROAD. THE MAGAZINE FLEW THROUGH 
THE AIR, PAGES FLAPPING! | DON’T KNOW IF IT WAS A REMNANT 
SUBCONSCIOUS REFLEX FROM MY FORMER BASEBALL DAYS, BUT 
| 0O REMEMBER RECEIVING QUITE A FEW COLD STARES FROM 
PASSERSBY. THEY WERE PROBABLY THINKING, (WHAT THE...! WHO 
1S THIS WHACKED-OUT GUY...?! WHAT A WEIRDO...!), BUT, YOU KNOW 
WHAT, | DON’T CARE AT ALL!! IT’S THE HAPPIEST MOMENT OF MY 
21 YEARS OF LIFE, SO TOUGH!!
