Masashi Kishimoto coma | 








Greetings. With everyone's support, 
my first comic has been published. 
I'm ecstatic. Speaking of ecstatic, 
the first time | won an award for one 
of my manga, | was so happy | was 
flying high. But this time is 10 times 
better than that. | don't know how 
to say it, but this is the happiest 
moment of my life. But | guess I'm 
happiest knowing that this comic will 
be read and enjoyed. Yup, that's it! 
—Masashi Kishirroto, 2000 














Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (“mechanism”). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

UNTIL WE GET TO... IGS WILL ONLY 
THE RESTAURANT. =GET MORE DIFFICULT. 
OR, AT LEAST, 
THAT'S THE 


SPEECH | PLANNED 
Mg TO GIVE. 





This is the very first sketch of Naruto that | drew. 
It was for a one-shot story in the Japanese 
Weekly Shonen JSump's special seasonal edition, 
Akararu Surry. Notice that he wears boots 
instead of zor/ (traditional Japanese sandals). 


In the one-shot story, Nariwto wasn't a ninja comic 
at all, but just about magic and sorcery. Even though 
the setup was completely different from the current 
storyline, i¢ was the very first character-driven 
manga that | ever drew, and | liked the character so 
| decided to keep using him. But drawing the goggles 
each time was a pain! That's why | came up with the 
idea for the ninja A/ta/-ate Cheadband).

The picture on the right 
is from Karakuri 
C"mechanism”), the first 
story | submitted to 
Weekly Shonen Jump. 
Karakuri won the Hop 
Step Award for new 
manga artists, which 
allowed me to get 
picked up by my current 
editor and helped me 
begin my journey down 
the road of a manga 
artist. It’s a manga 
that brings back a lot 
of memories for me. 
But, man, the hero sure 
does have intensely 
terrifying eyes. 


The picture on the right 
is another one from the 
first manga | published 
in Weekly Shonen 
Jump...that's right, 
Karakuri! But when the 
reader polls came in, its 
popularity was rock 
bottom! Still, this 
manga also brings back 
a lot of memories for 
me.

The Kakashi That Might Have Been 


The Rejected Outline for 
the Second Chapter 


My original plan for Kakashi’s first appearance was to have him show up in the 
second chapter of Naruto (see page #61). He was meant to be a cool, affected, 
upper-level ninja who ended sentences (in the original Japanese) with the very 
polite “de gozaru” verb form. This was going to be before Sakura and Sasuke had 
been introduced. Kakashi would suddenly appear on the scene as Naruto's 
teacher. This idea was discarded after a discussion with my editor at Weekly 
Shonen Jump.As an outgrowth of things we discussed together, | was able to 
flesh out Kakashi, Sasuke, and Sakura into the characters they are today.

AN ANECDOTE by Masashi Kishimoto 


Coming from the country, | grew up surrounded by the beauties of 
nature, trees, plants, and open ground. So moving to Tokyo was quite 
a shock. There was hardly a plant or a natural setting to be found. | 
had to do something to create the country atmosphere and keep 
myself from feeling homesick. Something that would soothe me 
enough that | could concentrate on creating good manga. So | decid- 
ed to buy a houseplant for my desk. 

Kishimoto: “From now on, you’re my partner!” 

| even gave my plant a name: Ukki-kun, as in “Mr. Ukki.” 

Kishimoto: “Well, Ukki, you look very shiny and green 


today!” 

Ukki: “......... i 

Kishimoto: “It was a good day for photosynthesis, huh?” 
Ukki: “......... - 


Kishimoto: “Today I’m going to give you an excellent 
fertilizer for vigorous growth!” 

We were a super-team. 

Assistant A: “What is this, Mr. Kishimoto? How did your 
plant get all dried out?” 

Kishimoto: “What are you saying?! | gave Ukki the best 
care!” 

Assistant A: “You mean this? This fertilizer is 
concentrated, so you need to dilute it a lot. Oh no! You 
mean you didn’t dilute it?!” 

Sigh...
