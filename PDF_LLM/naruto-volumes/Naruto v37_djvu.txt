It was fixed for the graphic novel, 
but when Number 334 (“The 
Black Metamorphoses...//") was 
printed in /usnp it was still in 
penciled format. | had herniated 
a disk for the first time in my 

life and just couldn't sit at my 
desk... Please forgive me for the 
hard-on-the-eyes manuscript. 





—Masashi Kishimoto, 2007 


Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

Against all odds, Uzumaki Naruto, the student least likely to 
graduate from the Ninja Academy in Konohagakure, becomes 
a ninja along with his classmates—and closest friends—Sasuke 
and Sakura. During the Chinin Selection Exams, however, the 
turncoat ninja Orochimaru launches Operation Destroy 

Konoha, forcing Naruto’s mentor, the Third Hokage, to 

sacrifice his own life to stop the attack and save the village. 





or 4 


















Further tragedy follows when Sasuke—now one of Konoha’s 
best and brightest shinobi—falls prey to Orochimaru’s 
schemes and becomes his hapless thrall. Though Naruto fights 
valiantly to stop Sasuke from becoming slave to one of their 
worst enemies, he ultimately fails. Sasuke flees to Orochimaru, 
and Naruto vows to rescue his friend someday... 









Two years pass. Naruto and his comrades grow up and track 
down Sasuke. However, they are left in the dust again by 
Sasuke’s immense power and he gets away once more. 







In order to gain strength himself, Naruto trains with Kakashi 
again. Elsewhere, Asuma dies during a battle against an 

Akatsuki two-man team. What will the surviving Cell Number 
10 do now?!
