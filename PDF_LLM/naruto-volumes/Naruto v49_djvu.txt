_—— Story & Art by 
~ Ma 


Recently, because | get lonely when 

| am working alone, | Keep movies 
playing continuously while | work. I'll 
occasionally glance at the movie 
while focusing on work, but then I'll 
Suddenly realize that I'm focused 

on the movie and just occasionally 
scribbling on the paper. It's especially 
bad when it comes to trilogies/ 





Seriously... (beads of sweat) 


—Masashi Kishitmoto, 2070 


Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

THE STORY SO FAR... 


Naruto, the biggest troublemaker at the Ninja Academy in the Village 
of Konohagakure, finally becomes a ninja along with his classmates 
Sasuke and Sakura. They grow and mature through countless trials and 
battles. However, Sasuke, unable to give up his quest for vengeance, 
leaves Konohagakure to seek Orochimaru and his power... 

Two years pass. Naruto grows up and engages in fierce battles against 
the tailed beast-targeting Akatsuki. Elsewhere, after winning the heroic 
battle against Itachi and learning his older brother's true intentions, 
Sasuke allies with the Akatsuki and sets out to destroy Konoha! 

Thanks to Naruto’s actions, the crisis of the village’s destruction comes 
to an end, but Danzo of the Black Ops is appointed Sixth Hokage in 
Tsunade’s place. Amidst all this, the Raikage’s summons goes out and a 
Gokage Summit is set to begin!
