— Masashi Kishimoto, 2014 








Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
e won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

THE STORY SO FAR... 


Naruto, the biggest troublemaker at the Ninja Academy in the 
Village of Konohagakure, finally becomes a ninja along with his 
classmates Sasuke and Sakura. They grow and mature through 
countless trials and battles. However, Sasuke, unable to give up his 
quest for vengeance, leaves Konohagakure to seek Orochimaru and 
his power... 

Two years pass. Naruto grows up and engages in fierce battles 
against the Tailed Beast-targeting Akatsuki.And the Fourth Great 
Ninja War against the Akatsuki finally begins. Having been revived 
thanks to Rinne Rebirth, Madara then captures all the biju and gains 
Six Paths power. With Kurama taken from him, Naruto teeters on the 
verge of death, as does Sasuke who is defeated by Madara. Meanwhile, 
Might Guy arrives just in time to protect Kakashi and the others from 
Madara's onslaught. In order to protect those precious to him, Guy 
finally reveals his most forbidden jutsu!
