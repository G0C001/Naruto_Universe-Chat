Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

THE STORY SO FAR... 


Naruto, the biggest troublemaker at the Ninja Academy in the Village of 
Konohagakure, finally becomes a ninja along with his classmates Sasuke 
and Sakura. They grow and mature through countless trials and battles. 
However, Sasuke, unable to give up his quest for vengeance, leaves Kono- 
hagakure to seek Orochimaru and his power... 

Two years pass. Naruto grows up and engages in fierce battles against 
the Tailed Beast-targeting Akatsuki. Elsewhere, after winning the heroic 
battle against Itachi and learning his older brother's true intentions, 
Sasuke allies with the Akatsuki and sets out to destroy Konoha! 

The Akatsuki leader Pain assaults Konoha in search of the nine-tailed 
biju-bearing Naruto! With fierce and violent skill, he lays waste to 
Konoha. When Naruto returns home to face the enemy, the results of 
his senjutsu training are apparent, but will it be enough to defeat the 
Akatsuki...?!
