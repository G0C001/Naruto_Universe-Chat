—Masashi Kishimoto, 2005 





Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

Twelve years ago a destructive nine-tailed fox spirit attacked 
the ninja village of Konohagakure. The Hokage, or village 
champion, defeated the fox by sealing its soul into the body of 
a baby boy. Now that boy, Uzumaki Naruto, has grown up to 
be a ninja-in-training, learning the art of ninjutsu with his 
teammates Sakura and Sasuke. During the Second Chiinin 
Exam, Orochimaru, a former student of the Third Hokage, 
attacks Naruto and the others. He leaves a curse mark upon 
Sasuke and then vanishes. 

During the Third Exam, Orochimaru and company return to 
launch Operation Destroy Konoha, a campaign that ends with 
the sacrifice of Lord Hokage's life. Following the fierce battle 
against Orochimaru and Kabuto, Lady Tsunade then becomes 
the Fifth Hokage. 

In the wake of the battle, Konoha suffers yet another loss 
when Sasuke, tempted by Orochimaru's offer of power, leaves 
with the Sound Ninja Four. Desperate to save his friend, 
Naruto enters into a bitter fight with Sasuke, but is ultimately 
unable to stop him. Amid movement by both Orochimaru 
and the mysterious organization the Akatsuki, Naruto and 
the others begin further training!

AXING 











THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, VIDEO GAMES FART 2 


AS| PREVIOUSLY WROTE IN VOLUME 25,1 ESPECIALLY LIKED 
CARTRIDGE GAMES, SUCH AS "THE LEGEND OF ZELDA,"'"ZELDA 2: 
ADVENTURE OF LINK," "THE MYSTERIOUS CASTLE MURASAME," "KID 
ICARUS," "CASTLEVANIA," AND "METROID." YOU COULD SAVE AND 
RELOAD THESE GAMES, WHICH, FOR ME BACK THEN, WAS 
TREMENDOUSLY APPEALING. RECENTLY, MANY OF THESE GAMES 
WERE RE-RELEASED FOR THE GAME BOY, SO | DECIDED TO TRY 
THEM OUT AGAIN... | WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED TO DISCOVER 
THEY WERE STILL QUITE FUN. IN FACT, | BEAT THEM ALL (ALTHOUGH 
BECAUSE | DON'T HAVE A LOT OF FREE TIME, | WAS ONLY PLAYING 
THEM SPORADICALLY). 


MOST OF MY CURRENT ASSISTANTS ARE ALSO OF THE FAMICOM 
GENERATION, SO WE OFTEN REMINISCE ABOUT THAT ERA, HAVING 
DISCUSSIONS LIKE, "REMEMBER HOW WE HAD TO 'RIOT' WITH JUST 
TWO CHARACTERS," OR "IN MISSISSIPPI ("MURDER ON THE 
MISSISSIPPI"), REMEMBER HOW YOU COULD KILL WITH JUST A 
SINGLE KNIFE THRUST," AND SO ON. AT SOME POINT, THE 
CONVERSATION WOULD ALWAYS TURN TO EITHER TO DRAGON 
QUEST OR THE FINAL FANTASY SERIES (| BET IT'S TRUE FOR YOU 
ALL AS WELL). WITH ONLY FARTIAL ALLEGIANCES--.E. FF FANS WHO 
STILL LIKE OQ AND 0@ FANS WHO STILL OWN FF GAMES--THERE 
EMERGE SOME BIZARRE COMMENTS. AS THE TALK GETS MORE 
ANO MORE HEATED, SOMEONE WILL INVARIABLY SHOUT OUT, "SO 
WHAT ABOUT YOU, KISHIMOTO-SAN?" 


AND MY REPLY WOULD BE, "| LOVE TORIYAMA-SENSEI'S ART, AND 
THE VERY FIRST GAME | EVER BOUGHT WAS DRAGON QUEST, SO | 
WANT TO SAY I'M A O@ FAN... BUT | WAS ALSO DRAWN TO FF 
BECAUSE OF ITS GLITCHES, LIKE THE ABILITY TO LEVEL-UP BY 
ATTACKING ONE'S ALLIES IN FFIl AND TO CANCEL ATTACKS BY 
PRESSING THE A AND 8 BUTTONS SIMULTANEOUSLY. IN FFIV, THE 
LITTLE TWINS PALOM AND POROM MADE ME CRY EVEN THOUGH IT 
WAS A GAME. THE TRANSITION FROM PIXEL ART TO POLYGONAL 36 
COMPUTER GRAPHICS IN FFVII WAS SO GROUNDBREAKING THAT | 
CAN'T DENY THAT | LOVE FF AS WELL. SO AM! AFF MANIAC? ... YET 
OQ WAS SO BALANCED TOO. | LOVED HOW PRINCE SAMANTORIA 
OF DQII--WHO ALWAYS DIED SO EASILY--WAS ABLE TO MASTER THE 
ZAORIKU, OR REVIVE SPELL. AND EVEN THOUGH THE "SPELL OF 
RESURRECTION" WAS REALLY LONG, THE MUSIC THAT PLAYED 
DURING THE PASSWORD SCREEN BECAME My FAVORITE OF THE 
OQ SERIES. BUT THEN, DQ@I~III'S "LEGEND OF THE HERO LOTO", |S 
A THREE-PART WORK THAT REALLY WAS A CLASSIC FOR ME TOO. 


.«5O IT'S REALLY HARD FOR ME TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE TWO, 
AND MY ASSISTANTS, TOO, THEY ALWAYS END UP GIVING VAGUE 
ANSWERS AS WELL. SO THE DEBATE |S USUALLY SETTLED WITH 
MUTUAL ADMIRATION FOR AND AGREEMENT ABOUT HOW 
INCREDIBLE THE COLLABORATION PROJECT GAME "CHRONO 
TRIGGER" WAS. WE ALL JUST LOVE VIDEO GAMES.
