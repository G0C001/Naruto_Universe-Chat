—Masashi Kishitnoto, 20029 


Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

THE STORY SO FAR... i 


Naruto, the biggest troublemaker at the Ninja Academy in Konohagakure, & 
finally becomes a ninja along with his classmates Sasuke and Sakura. They 
grow and mature through countless trials and battles. However, Sasuke, 
unable to give up his quest for vengeance, leaves Konohagakure to seek 
Orochimaru and his power... 

Two years pass. Naruto and his comrades grow up and head out once 
more. As their fierce battles against the Tailed Beast-targeting Akatsuki rage 
on, Sasuke rebels against Orochimaru and eventually absorbs him completely! 
Sasuke then gathers new companions and chases after his brother Itachi. 

But the Uchiha brother confrontation has an unexpected result. Sasuke 
learns a secret about Itachi that causes him to swear vengeance...on Konoha! 
To start his quest, he allies with the enemies of the Leaf Ninja, the Akatsuki, 
and sets out to capture the Eight-Tailed Beast!
