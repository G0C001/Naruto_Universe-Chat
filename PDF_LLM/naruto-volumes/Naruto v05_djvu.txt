often, | decided to spend what little 
money | had to purchase a DVD player. 
Ho ho ho...now | can enjoy movies with 
incredibly high image quality and Dolby 
Digital sound! Or so | thought, except 
that the movies | wanted to watch 
hardly ever came out on DVD, so | 
couldn't watch them anyway. 
Recently, however, the popularity of 
DVDs has finally risen, and more and more DVDs are 
coming out!! Yes! Except...now I'm so busy drawing manga 
that | don’t have time to watch them, even though | want 
to! Waah/ 

—Masashi Kishiroto, 2000 





Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (“Mechanism”). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

stantly distracted by her 
crush on Sasuke. Her goal: 
to win Sasuke’s heart! 


NARUTO JUL 


When Naruto was born, a 
destructive fox spirit was

attention-seeking trouble- 
maker. His goal: to become 
the village’s next Hokage. 





SASUKE *A77

One of the many student ninja from foreign villages who have traveled to 


Konohagakure for the Junior Ninja Selection Exams.VVhat does this creepy kid 
have in mind when he challenges Sasuke to a duel? Sasuke is about to find out! 


THE STORY SO FARR... 
Twelve years ago, a destructive nine-tailed fox spirit attacked the ninja village of 
Konohagakure. The Hokage, or village champion, defeated the fox by sealing its soul 


into the body of a baby boy. Now that boy, Uzumaki Naruto, has grown up to become 
a ninja-in-training, learning the art of ninjutsu with his classmates Sakura and Sasuke. 


Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura have been nominated by their instructor Kakashi to take 
the Junior Ninja Selection Exams, which they must pass to advance to the next level of 
ninja training. The village is crawling with student ninja from villages near and far, who 
are all determined to ace the exams. On their way to turn in the applications, they 
observe their fellow students’ advanced skill and training, and Naruto and his class- 
mates begin to suspect that theyre in way over their heads....

THE ROUGH SKETCHES ABOVE SHOW HOW | LAY OUT THE VISUAL 
FLOW OF AN ACTION SEQUENCE. | TRY TO BE VERY CONSCIOUS 
OF THE FLOW OF SCENES IN NARUTO, SO AS SOON AS | COME 

UP WITH AN IDEA FOR AN ACTION SEQUENCE, | CHOREOGRAPH 
ITINA SET OF THUMBNAIL DRAWINGS, LIKE STORYBOARDS. | TRY 
TO KEEP THE OVERALL FAGE COUNT FOR THE CHAPTER IN MIND, 
BUT THINGS USUALLY KEEP EXFANDING AND OPENING OUT, TAKING 
UP MORE AND MORE FAGES, WHILE | WORK OUT THE BEST CAMERA 
ANGLES, WITHOUT EVEN A THOUGHT TO WHERE THE DIALOGUE 
WILL FALL. NEXT | NUMBER THE SKETCHES, FIGURE OUT WHICH 
SCENES ARE THE MOST CRUCIAL, MAKE SURE THE TWO-FAGE 
SPREADS WILL ACTUALLY LAND ON FAGES THAT FACE EACH 
OTHER... AND THEN | NUMBER THE FAGES AND BREAK THEM 
DOWN INTO FANELS, THEN | DISCOVER I'VE USED UP MORE FAGES 
THAN IM SUPPOSED TO HAVE IN THE ENTIRE CHAPTER... WHICH 
MEANS | HAVE TO GO BACK AND CUT SEQUENCES AND ERASE 

THINGS... CRYING LIKE A BABY ALL THE WHILE. YOU KNOW... 

IT JUST OCCURRED TO ME... 
THIS MAY BE WHY MY SCRIPTS ARE ALWAYS SO LATE!
