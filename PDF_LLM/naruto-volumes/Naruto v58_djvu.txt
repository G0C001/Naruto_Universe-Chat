next year. | am eternally 
indebted to everyone on the 
animation staff! And | also have 
nothing but words of gratitude 
to all you readers who have

— Masashi Kishimoto, 2011 


Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

THE STORY SO FAR... 


Naruto, the biggest troublemaker at the Ninja Academy in the Village of 
Konohagakure, finally becomes a ninja along with his classmates Sasuke and 
Sakura. They grow and mature through countless trials and battles. 
However, Sasuke, unable to give up his quest for vengeance, leaves 
Konohagakure to seek out power from the renegade ninja Orochimaru. 

Two years pass. Naruto grows up and engages in fierce battles against the 
Tailed Beast-targeting Akatsuki. Elsewhere, after winning the heroic battle 
against Itachi and learning his older brother's true intentions, Sasuke allies 
with the Akatsuki and sets out to destroy Konoha. 

Upon Madara’s declaration of war, the Five Kage put together an Allied 
Shinobi Force. The Fourth Great Ninja War against the Akatsuki begins. 
After Naruto learns that the war was launched with him as the target, he 
and Bee break out of the training grounds. They then dissuade Tsunade and 
Raikage, who had come to stop them, and rush towards the battlefield!!
