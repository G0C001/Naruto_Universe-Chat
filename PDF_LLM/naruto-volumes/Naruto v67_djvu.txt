TMUD?P! 


— Masashi Kishimoto, 2013 





Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

THE STORY SO FAR... 


Naruto, the biggest troublemaker at the Ninja Academy in the 
Village of Konohagakure, finally becomes a ninja along with his 
classmates Sasuke and Sakura. They grow and mature through 
countless trials and battles. However, Sasuke, unable to give up his 
quest for vengeance, leaves Konohagakure to seek Orochimaru and 
his power... 

Two years pass. Naruto grows up and engages in fierce battles 
against the Tailed Beast-targeting Akatsuki.And the Fourth Great 
Ninja War against the Akatsuki finally begins. Naruto and his 
companions face off against the reunited Obito and Madara in order 
to stop the resurrected Ten Tails! Ten Tails’ power seems too great to 
handle, but Sasuke enters the battlefield along with the 
Edotensei-resurrected former Hokage. With Cell 7 reunited at last, 
the battle starts to turn in Naruto's favor. However, Obito then 
surprises everyone by becoming the Ten Tails’ jinchuriki!
