Recently, | haven't been exercising 
at all/! And so now, when | bike up 
even a slight incline, | get muscle 
cramps...And not just in my legs, 
but in my arms, too! Why? 


Masashi Kishirioto, 2003 





Author/artist Masashi Kishimoto was born in 1974 in rural 
Okayama Prefecture, Japan. After spending time in art college, 
he won the Hop Step Award for new manga artists with his 
manga Karakuri (Mechanism). Kishimoto decided to base his 
next story on traditional Japanese culture. His first version of 
Naruto, drawn in 1997, was a one-shot story about fox spirits; 
his final version, which debuted in Weekly Shonen Jump in 
1999, quickly became the most popular ninja manga in Japan.

VOL. 17 
ITACHI'S POWER 


STORY AND ART BY 
MASASHI KISHIMOTO 














LEN 
Teatro ear Tsunade oes 


Idsf u SAAS 





Twelve years ago a destructive nine-tailed fox spirit 
attacked the ninja village of Konohagakure. The Hokage, 
or village champion, defeated the fox by sealing its soul 
into the body of a baby boy. Now that boy, Uzumaki 
Naruto, has grown up to be a ninja-in-training, learning 
the art of ninjutsu with his teammates Sakura and 
Sasuke. 













Naruto and company take on the Chinin Selection 
Exams but suffer a sudden attack from Orochimaru in 
the Forest of Death. Orochimaru leaves a curse mark 
on Sasuke’s body and vanishes, only to return during 

the final round to launch Operation Destroy Konoha! 












While Naruto battles Gaara, the Third Hokage 
sacrifices himself to defeat Orochimaru. Konohagakure 
is saved, and Jiraiya and Naruto set out to hunt down 
the elusive Tsunade to fill the position of Fifth Hokage, 
but they are pursued by two menacing shadows...

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, PART 25 


ACCEPTED FOR THE HOP »’ STEP AWARD! | HAD WON! 
THE WINNING WORK FOR THAT MONTH'S HOP Xx STEP AWARD 
WAS PROMISED PRINTING IN AKAMURU JUMP. “FINALLY, MY 
MANGA WILL BE SEEN BY THE WORLD!” | RECALL BEING SO 
OVERJOYED THAT | PRANCEO AROUND, TALKING TO MYSELF 
IN AHIGH-PITCHEO VOICE ANO LAUGHING AT HOME. | WANTED 
TO TELL SOMEONE HOW HAPPY | WAS! SO | IMMEDIATELY 
CALLED MY PARENTS’ HOUSE. MY MOTHER ANSWERED. 


MASASHI: “MOM! | WON JUMP’S HOP ** STEP AWARD! 
"VE BEEN ACCEPTED! ACCEPTED!” 

MA: “WHAT? ACCEPTED FOR WHAT?” 

MASASHI: “...UH...! UM... JUMP CHOOSES FROM AMONG 
SUBMITTED ENTRIES OF NEWCOMER ARTISTS 
AND GIVES THEM AN AWARD. | GOT PICKED FOR 
AN AWARD FOR PEOPLE WHO WILL ONE DAY 


BECOME MANGA ARTISTS!” 
MA: “WHO?” 
MASASHI: “ME, | DIO!” 
MA: “AHH, | SEE! GOOD FOR YOU...” 


MASASHI: “SO NOW I’M ONE STEP CLOSER TO BECOMING 
AMANGA ARTIST! I'M GOING TO START 
DRAWING MORE AND MORE MANGA... AND...” 


MA: “SO, ARE YOU EATING PROPERLY?” 

MASASHI: “...0” 

MA: “DON'T YOU BE EATING THOSE GROCERY STORE 
RAMEN! YOU HAVE TO EAT YOUR VEGGIES!” 

MASASHI: ™...” 

MA: “ANDO EAT STEWED THINGS! IT’S GOOD FOR YOU!” 

MASASHI: “ALL RIGHT... HEY, | GOTTA GO... MY CALLING 
CARDO’'S ALMOST EMPTY...” 

MA: “SURE! WELL THEN... TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF!” 


MASASHI: “YEAH...” 


SHE DIDN'T REALLY GET MY HAPPINESS... IT SEEMS MY 
MAWAS MORE CONCERNED ABOUT MY HEALTH THAN 
ABOUT A MANGA AWARD. SO | THOUGHT | WOULD START 
CHURNING OUT MANGA WHILE WATCHING MY HEALTH. 
THAT HELPED COOL ME OFF FROM MY HIGH.

THE WORLD OF KISHIMOTO MASASHI 
MY PERSONAL HISTORY, PART 26 


BACK THEN, | DION’T HAVE A PHONE IN MY ROOM, SO 
IWAS MAKING AND RECEIVING CALLS FROM MY 
BOARDINGHOUSE LANOLORDO’S PHONE. THE NIGHT 
THE AWARDS ANNOUNCEMENT WAS PRINTED IN JUMF, 
| RECEIVED A CALL FROM SHUEISHA’S JUMP EDITING 
OEPARTMENT. 


“KISHIMOTO-KUN! | THINK YOU'VE GOT A CALL FROM A 
JUMP EDITOR,” MY LANOLORD SAID WHILE STANDING 
OUTSIDE MY ROOM CLUTCHING THE EXTRA HANOSET 
OF THE HOME PHONE. (WH..WHAT?!) “UH, OK! I'LL BE 
RIGHT THERE!” | KICKED OUT OF MY ROOM AND TOOK 
THE RECEIVER AWAY. 


THE HOLD BUTTON OF THE HANDSET WAS BLINKING. 


(SH-SHOOT! ARE YOU SAYING THAT I'W CONNECTED 
TO AZ... JUMP EDITOR RIGHT NOW?! THIS RECEIVER'S 
CONNECTED TO JUMP!) 


I WAS SO NERVOUS THAT | THOUGHT MY HEART WOULD 
BURST, AND | EVEN FORGOT TO BREATHE. 


(¢..UM, WHAT SHOULD | SAY? HOW AM | SUPPOSED TO 
TALK TO HIM... U...UH... |-l’VE GOT TO PICK UP THE LINE... | 
SHOULDN'T KEEP HIM WAITING!) (...BUT | HAVE TO MAKE 
SURE NOT TO BE DISCOURTEOUS!...) 


(OH, MAN, I'M SO NERVOUS! ‘CUZ IT’S JUMP!) 


(AARGH! IT’S NO USE DAWDLING! ONE GIANT 
NEW STEP FOR MEEE!) 


AND WITH THAT, THE YOUNG KISHIMOTO PRESSED 
THE BUTTON... 


BZ2222222ZZ... 


|HAD MISTAKENLY PRESSED THE END BUTTON INSTEAD 
OF THE HOLD BUTTON, AND HUNG UP ON THE JUMP EDITOR 
THAT HAO TAKEN THE TIME TO CALL ME. BUT THE KIND AND 
GENTLE YAHAGI-SAN GENEROUSLY CHOSE TO CALL THIS 
INCREDIBLY DISCOURTEOUS FOOL BACK... 


“HELLO? THIS IS YAHAGI OF JUMP. SORRY WE WERE 
DISCONNECTED. IS THE RECEPTION BAD WHERE YOU ARE...?”
